NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of IssuesIdentification of Goods Requires Amendment 
•
 
Search of Office Records
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Identification of Goods Requires Amendment
 
Applicant submitted the following identification of goods with the application:
            
          International Class 13
 
Leather goods, namely, holsters and pistol holsters 
 
International Class 18
 
Leather goods, namely, bags, purses, tote bags, book bags, wallets, handbags, backpacks, 
belts, sleigh bells
 
International Class 25
 
Costumes for use in role-playing, in the amusement industry and for historical renactments; 
historical costumes
 
The above bolded wording in the identification of goods requires amendment because it does not 
identify the goods with enough specificity to make clear the scope of the goods offered by applicant. 
Further, the wording could identify goods in more than one international class and is thus 
overbroad.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. 
 
Therefore, the identification of goods as submitted with the application requires the following 
amendments.
 
International Class 18
 
The wording "Leather goods, namely, bags, purses, tote bags, book bags, wallets, handbags, backpacks, 
belts, sleigh bells" is indefinite as written because the nature of the goods is unclear. The wording could 
also be used to describe goods in multiple international classes and is thus overbroad. For example, 
"motorcycle bags, namely, saddle bags" are in Class 12 while "hip bags" are in Class 18. 
 
International Class 25 
 
The wording "historical costumes" is indefinite as written because the nature of the goods is unclear. 
Applicant must use additional wording to clarify the nature of the goods. 
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification of goods, if accurate:International Class 13
 
Leather goods, namely, holsters and pistol holsters 
 
International Class 15
 
musical instruments, namely, sleigh bells
 
International Class 18
 
Leather goods, namely, travel bags, purses, tote bags, book bags, wallets, handbags, backpacks, 
leather shoulder belts 
 
International Class 25
 
Costumes for use in role-playing, in the amusement industry and for historical renactments; adult 
dress-up costumes in the nature of historical figures
 
International Class 28 
 
Christmas tree ornaments, namely, sleigh bells
 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods or services, but not to broaden or 
expand the goods or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06.  Generally, any deleted goods or services may not later be 
reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that 
are classified in at least 5 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 3 
class(es).  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the 
submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already 
paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy therequirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.

•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
