IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES - CLASSES 16, 38, 
AND 45 ONLY 
 
The identification of goods and services is indefinite and must be clarified because the entries lack 
requisite specificity and may belong in more than one international class. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must amend the identification to specify the common commercial or 
generic name of the goods. See TMEP §1402.01. If the goods have no common commercial or generic 
name, applicant must describe the product, its main purpose, and its intended uses. See id. If the 
services have no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe or explain the nature of 
the services using clear and succinct language. See id.
 
Applicant may adopt the following International Class 16 identification, if accurate: 
 
Printed publications, namely, series of books, study guides, pamphlets, newsletters, and teaching 
activity guides in the fields of Christian teaching and inspiration 
 
Applicant may adopt the following International Class 38 identification, if accurate: 
 
Streaming of audio and video recordings featuring Christian teachings and inspiration over the 
Internet 
 
Applicant may adopt the following International Class 41 identification, if accurate: 
 
Education services, namely, providing seminars, workshops and classes via simulcast events, and live 
events in the nature of classes in the field of Christian music, teaching, and inspiration and distribution 
of training materials in connection therewith 
 
Applicant may add and adopt the following International Class 9 identification, if accurate: 
 
Downloadable educational publications, namely, printable study guides, pamphlets, newsletters, and 
teaching activity guides in the fields of Christian teaching and inspiration
 
If adding a class, applicant must comply with the multiple-class application requirements below.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later bereinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).

TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS - ADVISORY 
 
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) 
already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 
5 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 4 class(es). Applicant 
must either (a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or 
(b) restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)         Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for class(es) 41 and 45; and applicant needs a specimen for class(es) 16 and 38. 
See more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or 
advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerceon or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as 
early as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(a) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
SPECIMEN REQUIRED - INTERNATIONAL CLASS 16 AND 38 ONLY 
 
Specimen does not show use of the mark in commerce. Registration is refused because the specimen 
does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in International Class(es) 16 and 38. 
Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP 
§§904, 904.07(a). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods 
identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Specifically, the specimen fails to show use of the mark in connection with International Class 16 
printed publications. In addition, it fails to show the applicant is providing streaming services under the 
mark. While they may utilize streaming services to broadcast the their ministry services, they are not a 
provider of streaming services to others.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c).  Any webpage 
printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was 
accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a 
verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include: 
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).  Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a 
specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen 
itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. 
§2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 
1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior tothe filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
APPLICANT'S PHYSICAL DOMICILE ADDRESS REQUIRED 
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record identifies a 
post office box or mail forwarding service and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal place 
of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). A 
domicile address must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an 
individual applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal place 
of business, which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
Applications must include an applicant’s domicile address because such domicile determines whether 
an applicant is required to have a U.S.-licensed attorney represent it before the USPTO. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.11(a), 2.32(a)(2); TMEP §§601, 803.05. An applicant whose domicile is located outside of the 
United States or its territories must be represented at the USPTO by an attorney who is an active 
member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a U.S. state or territory. 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); 
TMEP §601.01(a).
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile 
as a post office box or mail forwarding service instead of a street address. In most cases, a post office 
box or mail forwarding service is not acceptable as a domicile address because it does not identify the 
location of applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control 
the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1).
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide documentation showing that the listed 
U.S. domicile address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that 
applicant has no fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §§601.01(b)-(b)(1), 803.05(a).
 
If applicant amends the application to list a domicile street address located outside of the United States 
or its territories, applicant must appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney under 37 C.F.R. §11.14 as its 
representative before the application may proceed to registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); TMEP 
§601.01(a). See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information. However, if applicantestablishes its domicile street address is located within the United States or its territories, applicant is 
not required to appoint a qualified U.S.-licensed attorney. See TMEP §601.01(b).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s domicile address. Applicant should provide the 
most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP 
§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.
 
To appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney in the application, applicant should submit a completed TEAS 
Change Address or Representation form. The newly-appointed attorney must submit a TEAS Response 
to Examining Attorney Office Action form indicating that an appointment of attorney has been made 
and address all other refusals or requirements in this action, if any. Alternatively, if applicant retains an 
attorney before filing the response, the attorney can respond to this Office action by using the 
appropriate TEAS response form and provide his or her attorney information in the form and sign it as 
applicant’s attorney. See 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b)(1)(ii); TMEP §604.01.

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
