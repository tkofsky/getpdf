INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
REFUSAL - SECTION 2(d) - LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
•
POTENTIAL REFUSAL - PRIOR-FILED APPLICATION
•
REQUIREMENT - IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
•
 
REFUSAL - SECTION 2(d) - LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark(s) in 
the following U.S. Registration(s):
 
Reg. No. 5332693 (“STURDY” in design plus word mark form for goods including “Protective 
work gloves”)
•
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached 
registration(s).
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that so resembles a registered mark 
that it is likely a potential consumer would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the source of the 
goods and/or services of the applicant and registrant.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  A determination of 
likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d) is made on a case-by case basis and the factors set forth in 
In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) aid 
in this determination.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d 1344, 1349, 98 USPQ2d 
1253, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citing On-Line Careline, Inc. v. Am. Online, Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1085, 56 
USPQ2d 1471, 1474 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).  Not all the du Pont factors, however, are necessarily relevant or 
of equal weight, and any one of the factors may control in a given case, depending upon the evidence of 
record.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d at 1355, 98 USPQ2d at 1260; In re 
Majestic Distilling Co., 315 F.3d 1311, 1315, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see In re E. I. 
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d at 1361-62, 177 USPQ at 567.
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant:  similarity of the marks, similarity and nature 
of the goods and/or services, and similarity of the trade channels of the goods and/or services.  See In re 
Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Dakin’s 
Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d 1593, 1595-96 (TTAB 1999); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
Comparison of the MarksApplicant’s applied-for mark is “PRETTY STURDY” in standard character form. The mark in the 
registration is indicated above.
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F. 3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014) (citing In re 1st USA Realty 
Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007)); In re White Swan Ltd., 8 USPQ2d 1534, 1535 
(TTAB 1988)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
The registered mark contains design elements, however, when evaluating a composite mark consisting 
of words and a design, the word portion is normally accorded greater weight because it is likely to 
make a greater impression upon purchasers, be remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or 
request the goods and/or services. In re Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 
2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); 
TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks must be compared in their entireties, the word portion is 
often considered the dominant feature and is accorded greater weight in determining whether marks are 
confusingly similar, even where the word portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 
1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 
1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 1983)). As such, the word "STURDY" represents the 
dominant element of the registered mark.
 
For the word portions of the marks, applicant has simply added the word "PRETTY" to the beginning 
of the "STURDY" wording which appears in the registration. Adding a term to wording appearing in a 
registered mark generally does not obviate the similarity between the compared marks, as in the present 
case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d). See Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. 
Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106 (C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding 
BENGAL and BENGAL LANCER and design confusingly similar); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 
USPQ2d 1266, 1269 (TTAB 2009) (holding TITAN and VANTAGE TITAN confusingly similar); In 
re El Torito Rests., Inc., 9 USPQ2d 2002, 2004 (TTAB 1988) (holding MACHO and MACHO 
COMBOS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii). In the present case, the word portions of the 
marks are identical in part.
 
With respect to the stylization of the wording in the registered mark, the applied-for mark is in standard 
character form. A mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in any lettering style; the 
rights reside in the wording or other literal element and not in any particular display or rendition. See In 
re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 
601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. §2.52(a); TMEP 
§1207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a mark presented in stylized characters and/or with a design element generally 
will not avoid likelihood of confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters because the word 
portion could be presented in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 
101 USPQ2d at 1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 
1983) (stating that “the argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable where one party 
asserts rights in no particular display”). As such, the "STURDY" wording from applicant's mark could 
be displayed in the exact same font and stylization as how the identical word appears in the registered 
mark and also alongside the same design elements.Each of the marks shares the identical "STURDY" wording and uses this wording in connection with 
types of clothing items. Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms appear in 
the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 
USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly 
similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and 
CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
As such, viewed as a whole, applicant’s mark is confusingly similar to the registered mark.
 
Comparison of the Goods
 
Applicant’s goods are identified as “clothing and apparrel for everyday use.” The relevant goods from 
the registration are listed further above.
 
The goods and/or services of the parties need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood 
of confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 
1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 
2000) (“[E]ven if the goods in question are different from, and thus not related to, one another in kind, 
the same goods can be related in the mind of the consuming public as to the origin of the goods.”); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). 
 
The respective goods and/or services need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The attached Internet evidence consists of screenshots of products from the websites 
of Carhartt, Duluth Trading Co. and Dickies. Each of these companies manufactures both protective 
work gloves and types of clothing suitable for everyday use such as t-shirts. This evidence establishes 
that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces or provides the relevant goods and/or services 
and markets the goods under the same mark.  Therefore, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or 
services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty 
Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 
1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009). 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. Applicant should note the following 
potential ground for refusal.
 
POTENTIAL REFUSAL - PRIOR-FILED APPLICATION
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 90138171 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore,upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
Upon receipt of applicant’s response resolving the following requirement(s), action on this application 
will be suspended pending the disposition of U.S. Application Serial No(s). 90138171.  37 C.F.R. 
§2.83(c); TMEP §§716.02(c), 1208.02(c).
 
REQUIREMENT - IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS  
 
The wording “apparrel” in the identification of goods appears to be misspelled and is thus indefinite; 
the spelling must be corrected or the wording further clarified. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§1402.01(a). Applicant may substitute the following wording for the incorrect spelling, if accurate: 
“apparel.” Additionally, the wording in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified 
becausetypes of clothing and apparel must be indicated, for example, shirts or pants. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. 
 
Please also note that the wording “clothing” and "apparel" generally could identify goods in more than 
one international class. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. For example, clothing 
for protective purposes belongs in International Class 9 and medical clothing belongs in International 
Class 25. Standard, non-specialized clothing is properly classified in International Class 25 and due to 
the wording "for everyday use" appearing in the identification of goods, the suggested amendment 
below only provides options relating to that particular class. For assistance with identifying and 
classifying goods in trademark applications, please see the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable 
Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See TMEP §1402.04.
 
 
Applicant should note that any wording in bold, in italics, underlined and/or in ALL CAPS below 
offers guidance and/or shows the changes being proposed for the identification of goods and/or 
services.  If there is wording in the applicant’s version of the identification of goods and/or services 
which should be removed, it will be shown with a line through it such as this: strikethrough.  When 
making its amendments, applicant should enter them in standard font, not in bold, in italics, underlined 
or in ALL CAPS.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 25: Clothing and apparel for everyday use, namely, ___ {indicate particular goods, e.g., shirts, 
pants}
 
See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.
 
An applicant may only amend an identification to clarify or limit the goods, but not to add to or 
broaden the scope of the goods.  37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); see TMEP §§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. Generally, 
any deleted goods may not later be reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e).CONCLUSION
 
Response guidelines.  For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action.  For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above.  For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements.  Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
If applicant has questions regarding this Office action, please telephone or e-mail the assigned 
trademark examining attorney.  All relevant e-mail communications will be placed in the official 
application record; however, an e-mail communication will not be accepted as a response to this Office 
action and will not extend the deadline for filing a proper response.  See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191;

“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
