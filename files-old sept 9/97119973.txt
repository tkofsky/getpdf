NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic ApplicationSystem (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
2(e)(1) Refusal: Applied-For Mark is Merely Descriptive
•
Identification of Goods and Services 
•
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal: Applied-For Mark is Merely Descriptive
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature and characteristic 
of applicant’s goods and/or services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see 
TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if “it immediately conveys information concerning a feature, quality, or 
characteristic of [an applicant’s] goods or services.” In re N.C. Lottery, 866 F.3d 1363, 1367, 123 
USPQ2d 1707, 1709 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (citing In re Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d 960, 963, 82 
USPQ2d 1828, 1831 (Fed. Cir. 2007)); TMEP §1209.01(b); see DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro 
Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting In re 
Abcor Dev. Corp., 588 F.2d 811, 814, 200 USPQ 215, 218 (C.C.P.A. 1978)).
 
The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s goods 
and/or services, not in the abstract. DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 
675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b). “Whether 
consumers could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the 
test.” In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).
 
In this case, the applied-for mark is “NEOBREAST” used in connection with “A novel 3D printed 
bioengineered breast for reconstruction or augmentation" in International Class 10 and "Provide a 
pathway to breast reconstruction or augmentation using a novel 3D printed bioengineered breast" in 
International Class 44 
 
The term "NEO" is defined as something new, recent, latest; a new, different, or modified way; or 
designating a compound related in some way to an older one. In addition, the term "breast" is the 
generic term for the applicant's goods and services and is defined as the corresponding gland in a 
female primate. See attached definitions from the Collins dictionary.Taken together, NEOBREAST 
would be perceived by consumers as describing a feature and characteristic of applicant's goods andservices, namely that the goods are new or modified breasts and the services involve breast 
reconstruction and augmentation using new or modified breasts.
 
Moreover, as shown by the attached evidence from Science Direct, Research Gate, Springer Link, and 
the American Journal of Roentgenology, the term NEOBREAST is commonly used in the relevant 
industry to refer to a new breast. For example:
 
Conclusions: RT to the neo-breast compared with no RT following immediate autologous free 
flap reconstruction for breast cancer is well tolerated at 1 year following surgery despite patients 
undergoing RT also having a higher cancer stage and more intensive surgical and systemic 
treatment. Neo-breast symptoms are more common in patients receiving RT by the EORTC 
Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire but not by the BREAST-Q. Patient-
reported results at 1 year after surgery suggest RT following immediate autologous free flap 
breast reconstruction is well tolerated. 
•
METHOD AND MATERIALS IRB approved retrospective review of women with a history of 
mastectomy and reconstruction (neobreast) including muscle flap and/or implant who had at 
least one MRI of the neobreast was performed over the period of 4/1/05 – 4/31/09. 
•
The Neo Breast formation occurs by mobilizing and reshaping the residual or remnant Breast 
into a new and better breast. The remnant tissue is then re-shaped into a new breast using 
techniques of Mastopexy(Breast Lift) for the majority of the time. 
•
In that procedure, the abdominal skin, subcutaneous fat, and rectus abdominis muscle with its 
associated native vasculature are used to create a neobreast.
•
 
As applied to the applicant's goods and services, the mark NEOBREAST, merely refers to the new 
breast that is bioengineered and breast reconstruction and augmentation using the new breast. The 
examining attorney refers once again to the attached evidence showing that “neobreast” is used in the 
relevant industry to describe new or modified breasts.  Accordingly, the mark is merely descriptive of 
the goods and services, and registration must be refused under Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act. 
 
Although applicant's mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below. 
 
Identification of Goods and Services 
 
The identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified because it is indefinite and too broad. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make 
clear what the goods and services are. Further, this wording could identify goods in more than one 
international class. For example, "3D bioprinted soft tissue preparations for use in breast reconstruction 
or augmentation treatments" are in International Class 5 and "3d printed bioengineered breast implant 
for reconstruction or augmentation made primarily from artificial materials are in International Class 
10. In addition, the Class 44 services do not specify the nature of the services. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:
 
International Class 5
 
“3D Bioprinted soft tissue preparations for use in breast reconstruction or augmentation treatments”International Class 10
 
"3d printed bioengineered breast implant for reconstruction or augmentation made primarily from 
artificial materials"
 
International Class 44
 
“Cosmetic and plastic surgery services, namely, surgical implantation of 3D printed bioengineered 
breast implants for the purpose of breast reconstruction or augmentation procedures” 
 
Scope Advisory 
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action.

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
