SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
FOREIGN REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE REQUIRED
•
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
•
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
•
UNSIGNED APPLICATION - DECLARATION REQUIRED 
•
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
FOREIGN REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE REQUIRED
 
The application specifies both an intent to use basis under Trademark Act Section 1(b) and a claim of 
priority under Section 44(d) based on a foreign application. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 1126(d); 37 
C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2), (a)(4). However, no copy of a foreign registration has been provided even though 
the application indicates applicant’s intent to rely on Section 44(e) as an additional basis for 
registration. See 15 U.S.C. §1126(e).
 
An application with a Section 44(e) basis must include a true copy, photocopy, certification, or certified 
copy of a foreign registration from an applicant’s country of origin. 15 U.S.C. §1126(e); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §§1004, 1004.01, 1016. In addition, an applicant’s country of origin must be a 
party to a convention or treaty relating to trademarks to which the United States is also a party, or must 
extend reciprocal registration rights to nationals of the United States by law. 15 U.S.C. §1126(b); 
TMEP §§1002.01, 1004.
 
Therefore, applicant must provide a copy of the foreign registration from applicant’s country of origin 
when it becomes available. TMEP §1003.04(a). A copy of a foreign registration must consist of a 
document issued to an applicant by, or certified by, the intellectual property office in applicant’s 
country of origin. TMEP §1004.01. If applicant’s country of origin does not issue registrations or 
Madrid Protocol certificates of extension of protection, applicant may submit a copy of the Madrid 
Protocol international registration that shows that protection of the international registration has been 
extended to applicant’s country of origin. TMEP §1016. In addition, applicant must also provide an 
English translation if the foreign registration is not written in English. 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP 
§1004.01(a)-(b). The translation should be signed by the translator. TMEP §1004.01(b).
 
If the foreign registration has not yet issued, or applicant requires additional time to procure a copy of 
the foreign registration (and English translation, as appropriate), applicant should so inform the 
trademark examining attorney and request that the U.S. application be suspended until a copy of the 
foreign registration is available. TMEP §§716.02(b), 1003.04(b).If applicant cannot satisfy the requirements of a Section 44(e) basis, applicant may request that the 
mark be approved for publication based solely on the Section 1(b) basis. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 
1126(e); 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §§806.02(f), 806.04(b), 1003.04(b). Although the mark may be 
approved for publication on the Section 1(b) basis, it will not register until an acceptable allegation of 
use has been filed. See 15 U.S.C. §1051(c)-(d); 37 C.F.R. §§2.76, 2.88; TMEP §1103. Please note that, 
if the U.S. application satisfied the requirements of Section 44(d) as of the U.S. application filing date, 
applicant may retain the priority filing date under Section 44(d) without perfecting the Section 44(e) 
basis, provided there is a continuing valid basis for registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(3)-(4); TMEP 
§§806.02(f), 806.04(b).
 
Alternatively, applicant has the option to amend the application to rely solely on the Section 44(e) basis 
and request deletion of the Section 1(b) basis. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §806.04. The foreign 
registration alone may serve as the basis for obtaining a U.S. registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3); 
TMEP §806.01(d).
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
 
Particular wording in the identification of goods and/or services is indefinite/too broad or misclassified 
and must be clarified for reasons explained below.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01,

golf putters; Stands for golf bags; Stands specially adapted for holding golf clubs;Divot repair Tools 
being golf accessories; Trolley bags for golf equipment 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e). 
 
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “GOLF” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, quality, 
characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
This wording appears in applicant’s identification of goods. 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “GOLF” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
UNSIGNED APPLICATION - DECLARATION REQUIRED

have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.

SUMMARY OF ISSUES:FOREIGN REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE REQUIRED
•
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
•
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
•
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
FOREIGN REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE REQUIRED
 
The application specifies both an intent to use basis under Trademark Act Section 1(b) and a claim of 
priority under Section 44(d) based on a foreign application. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 1126(d); 37 
C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2), (a)(4). However, no copy of a foreign registration has been provided even though 
the application indicates applicant’s intent to rely on Section 44(e) as an additional basis for 
registration. See 15 U.S.C. §1126(e).
 
An application with a Section 44(e) basis must include a true copy, photocopy, certification, or certified 
copy of a foreign registration from an applicant’s country of origin. 15 U.S.C. §1126(e); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §§1004, 1004.01, 1016. In addition, an applicant’s country of origin must be a 
party to a convention or treaty relating to trademarks to which the United States is also a party, or must 
extend reciprocal registration rights to nationals of the United States by law. 15 U.S.C. §1126(b); 
TMEP §§1002.01, 1004.
 
Therefore, applicant must provide a copy of the foreign registration from applicant’s country of origin 
when it becomes available. TMEP §1003.04(a). A copy of a foreign registration must consist of a 
document issued to an applicant by, or certified by, the intellectual property office in applicant’s 
country of origin. TMEP §1004.01. If applicant’s country of origin does not issue registrations or 
Madrid Protocol certificates of extension of protection, applicant may submit a copy of the Madrid 
Protocol international registration that shows that protection of the international registration has been 
extended to applicant’s country of origin. TMEP §1016. In addition, applicant must also provide an 
English translation if the foreign registration is not written in English. 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP 
§1004.01(a)-(b). The translation should be signed by the translator. TMEP §1004.01(b).
 
If the foreign registration has not yet issued, or applicant requires additional time to procure a copy of 
the foreign registration (and English translation, as appropriate), applicant should so inform the 
trademark examining attorney and request that the U.S. application be suspended until a copy of the 
foreign registration is available. TMEP §§716.02(b), 1003.04(b).
 
If applicant cannot satisfy the requirements of a Section 44(e) basis, applicant may request that the 
mark be approved for publication based solely on the Section 1(b) basis. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 
1126(e); 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §§806.02(f), 806.04(b), 1003.04(b). Although the mark may be 
approved for publication on the Section 1(b) basis, it will not register until an acceptable allegation of 
use has been filed. See 15 U.S.C. §1051(c)-(d); 37 C.F.R. §§2.76, 2.88; TMEP §1103. Please note that, 
if the U.S. application satisfied the requirements of Section 44(d) as of the U.S. application filing date, 
applicant may retain the priority filing date under Section 44(d) without perfecting the Section 44(e) 
basis, provided there is a continuing valid basis for registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(3)-(4); TMEP§§806.02(f), 806.04(b).
 
Alternatively, applicant has the option to amend the application to rely solely on the Section 44(e) basis 
and request deletion of the Section 1(b) basis. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §806.04. The foreign 
registration alone may serve as the basis for obtaining a U.S. registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3); 
TMEP §806.01(d).
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
 
Particular wording in the identification of goods and/or services is indefinite/too broad or misclassified 
and must be clarified for reasons explained below.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01,

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
