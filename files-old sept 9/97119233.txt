NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 22, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:Amended Drawing Page Not Acceptable
 
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending 
marks and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act 
Section 2(d). 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Amended Drawing Page Not Acceptable 
Applicant has requested to amend the mark in the application. The USPTO cannot accept the 
proposed changes because they would materially alter the mark in the drawing filed with the 
original application or as previously amended. 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)(2), (b)(2); TMEP §807.14. 
Accordingly, the proposed amendment will not be entered; the previous drawing of the mark will 
remain operative. See TMEP §807.17.
 
The original drawing shows the mark as a stylized letter "e". The proposed amended drawing 
shows the mark as featuring a long-sleeved shirt with a stylized letter "e" on the upper left of the 
shirt.
 
The USPTO cannot accept an amendment to a mark if it will materially alter the mark in the 
drawing filed with the original application, or in a previously accepted amended drawing. 37 
C.F.R. §2.72(a)(2), (b)(2); TMEP §807.14. An amendment to the mark is material when the 
USPTO would need to republish the mark with the change in the USPTO Trademark Official 
Gazette to fairly present the mark to the public. In re Thrifty, Inc., 274 F.3d 1349, 1352, 61 
USPQ2d 1121, 1123-24 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing In re Hacot-Columbier, 105 F.3d 616, 620, 41 
USPQ2d 1523, 1526 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §807.14.
 
That is, an amendment is material if the altered mark does not retain “the essence of the original 
mark” or if the new and old forms do not “create the impression of being essentially the same 
mark.” In re Hacot-Columbier, 105 F.3d at 620, 41 USPQ2d at 1526 (quoting Visa Int’l Serv. 
Ass’n v. Life-Code Sys., Inc., 220 USPQ 740, 743-44 (TTAB 1983)); see, e.g., In re Who? Vision 
Sys., Inc., 57 USPQ2d 1211, 1218 (TTAB 2000) (amendment from “TACILESENSE” to 
“TACTILESENSE” a material alteration); In re CTB Inc., 52 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (TTAB 1999) 
(amendment of TURBO with a design to just the typed word TURBO without design a material 
alteration).
 
When determining materiality, the addition of any element that would require a further search of 
the USPTO database for conflicting marks is also relevant. In re Guitar Straps Online LLC, 103 
USPQ2d 1745, 1747 (TTAB 2012) (citing In re Pierce Foods Corp., 230 USPQ 307, 308-09 
(TTAB 1986)); In re Who? Vision Sys. Inc., 57 USPQ2d at 1218-19; TMEP §807.14.
 
In the present case, applicant’s proposed amendment would materially alter the mark in the 
drawing filed with the original application or as previously amended because the addition of the 
long-sleeved shirt adds a design element that materially alters the commercial impression of the 
mark.
 
To avoid the application from abandoning, applicant must respond to this issue. TMEP §807.17. 
Applicant may respond by (1) withdrawing the request to amend the drawing, or (2) arguing that 
•the proposed amendment is not a material alteration of the mark.
 
For more information about changes to the mark in the drawing after the application filing date, 
please go to the Drawing webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) 
by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Closing 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, 
applicant is encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in 
this process. The assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance 
explaining the content of an Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot 
provide legal advice or statements about an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See 
Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office 
action. Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can 
provide additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. 
See TMEP §§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used 
for informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 
2.191; TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
