NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:Identification of Goods and Services Requirement
•
 
SEARCH OF OFFICE'S DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the Office's database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 
TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).
 
However, applicant must respond to the following requirement.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES REQUIREMENT
 
The identification of goods and services is indefinite and must be clarified because it does not 
sufficiently specify the nature of the goods and services in order to enable proper classification. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. 
 
Particularly, with respect to the downloadable software identified in International Class 009, applicant 
need not specify that the downloadable software features a software suite. Rather, the identification 
only needs to specify the purpose, use and/or function of the software identified. Moreover, for the 
"SAAS" services referenced in International Class 042, applicant must clarify the meaning of the 
acronym "Saas" included in the identification of services. 
 
Applicant may adopt the following wording, if accurate: 
 
International Class 009:    “Downloadable computer application software for the automation and 
validation of the compliance of information technology across multiple information technology 
frameworks with various types of security regulations and thresholds; Downloadable computer 
application software for the automation and validation of the compliance of information technology 
with security regulations and thresholds in the financial industry”; 
 
International Class 042:    “Providing online non-downloadable software for the automation and 
validation of the compliance of information technology across multiple information technology 
frameworks with various types of security regulations and thresholds; Software as a Service (SaaS) 
services featuring software for the automation and validation of the compliance of information 
technology across multiple information technology frameworks with various types of security 
regulations and thresholds; Providing online non-downloadable software for the automation and 
validation of the compliance of information technology with security regulations and thresholds in the 
financial industry; Software as a service (SaaS) services featuring software for the automation and 
validation of the compliance of information technology with security regulations and thresholds in the 
financial industry”.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and services, but not to broaden or 
expand the goods and services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).

TMEP §1402.04.How to respond.  Click to file a response to this nonfinal Office action.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120686
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
