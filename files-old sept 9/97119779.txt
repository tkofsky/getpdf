NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Officeaction.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
 
The application has been reviewed by the assigned examining attorney. 
 
Summary of Issues
 
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issues below:
 
Disclaimer Required 
1. 
Specimen Shows Ornamental Use in International Class 16 - Registration Refused 
2. 
Drawing and Specimen Do Not Match in International Class 16 - Registration Refused 
3. 
Applicant's Domicile Address Required 
4. 
 
15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
 Search Results
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
1.        Disclaimer Required 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “ALBERT" and "TEXAS” because it is primarily geographically 
descriptive of the origin of applicant’s goods and/or services. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); In re Societe 
Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1451-52 (Fed. Cir. 
1987); TMEP §§1210.01(a), 1210.06(a), 1213.03(a).
 
The 
attached 
evidence 
from 
https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/albert-tx 
and 
http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasHillCountryTowns/Albert-Texas.htm shows that "ALBERT" is a 
town in Texas. “TEXAS” is a state in the southern United States. See attached definition from the 
online American Heritage Dictionary. In this case, the goods and services originate in Albert, Texas.. 
Thus, "ALBERT" and "TEXAS" identify a generally known geographic place or location. See TMEP 
§§1210.02 et seq.
 
The goods and/or services for which applicant seeks registration originate in this geographic place or 
location as shown by the attached from applicant's website at https://www.alberttexas.com/ listing 
applicant's address as "Albert-Stonewall, TX."[1] See TMEP §1210.03.
 
Because the goods and/or services originate in this place or location, a public association of the goods 
and/or services with the place is presumed. See In re Hollywood Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 1852, 
1858 (TTAB 2014) (citing In re Spirits of New Merced, LLC, 85 USPQ2d 1614, 1621 (TTAB 2007)); 
TMEP §§1210.02(a) 1210.04.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “ALBERT" and "TEXAS” apart from the 
mark as shown.
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.  
 
2.     Specimen Shows Ornamental Use in International Class 16 - Registration Refused 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark as used on the specimen of record is merely a 
decorative or ornamental feature of the goods and, thus, does not function as a trademark to indicate the 
source of applicant’s goods and to identify and distinguish them from others. Trademark Act Sections 
1, 2, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1052, 1127; see In re Villeroy & Boch S.A.R.L., 5 USPQ2d 1451, 1454 
(TTAB 1987); TMEP §§904.07(b), 1202.03 et seq.
 
Whether a designation functions as a mark depends on the commercial impression it makes on the 
relevant public; that is, whether purchasers would likely regard it as a source-indicator for the goods. 
See In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1879 (TTAB 2017) (quoting In re Eagle Crest 
Inc., 96 USPQ2d 1227, 1229 (TTAB 2010)); TMEP §1202. The specimen and any other relevant 
evidence of use is reviewed to determine whether an applied-for mark is being used as a trademark. In 
re Bose Corp., 546 F.2d 893, 897, 192 USPQ 213, 216 (C.C.P.A. 1976); In re Volvo Cars of N. Am., 
Inc., 46 USPQ2d 1455, 1459 (TTAB 1998).
 
In this case, the mark as shown on the specimen would be perceived as merely a decorative or 
ornamental feature of the goods because it appears in large type and covers a large portion of the 
surface of the sticker. The size, location, dominance, and significance of the alleged mark as used on 
the goods are all relevant factors in determining the commercial impression of the applied-for mark. 
See, e.g., In re Peace Love World Live, LLC, 127 USPQ2d 1400, 1403 (TTAB 2018) (quoting In re 
Hulting, 107 USPQ2d 1175, 1178 (TTAB 2013)); In re Lululemon Athletica Can. Inc., 105 USPQ2d 
1684, 1687 (TTAB 2013) (quoting In re Right-On Co., 87 USPQ2d 1152, 1156 (TTAB 2008)); TMEP 
§1202.03(a).
 
In appropriate circumstances, applicant may overcome this refusal by satisfying one of the following 
options:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application (or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use) and (b) shows proper trademark use for each 
international class identified in the application or amendment to allege use.
 
(2)        Amend to the Supplemental Register, which is a second trademark register 
for marks not yet eligible for registration on the Principal Register, but which may become 
capable over time of functioning as source indicators.
 
(3)        Claim acquired distinctiveness under Trademark Act Section 2(f) by 
submitting evidence that the applied-for mark has become distinctive of applicant’s goods; 
that is, proof that applicant’s extensive use and promotion of the mark has allowed 
consumers now directly to associate the mark with applicant as the source of the goods.
 
(4)        Submit evidence that the applied-for mark is an indicator of secondarysource; that is, proof that the mark is already recognized as a source indicator for other 
goods or services that applicant sells/offers.
 
(5)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b). This option will 
later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements.
 
For an overview of the response options above and instructions on how to satisfy each option online 
using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Ornamental Refusal 
webpage.
 
Applicant is advised that options 1-4 above do not resolve the matching issue below.
 
3.         Drawing and Specimen Do Not Match in International Class 16 - Registration Refused 
 
Mark shown on drawing does not match mark on specimen. Registration is refused because the 
specimen does not show the mark in the drawing in use in commerce in International Class(es) 16, 
which is required in the application or amendment to allege use. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 
U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). The 
mark appearing on the specimen and in the drawing must match; that is, the mark in the drawing “must 
be a substantially exact representation of the mark” on the specimen. See 37 C.F.R. §2.51(a)-(b); TMEP 
§807.12(a).
 
The drawing of the mark is "ALBERT FREAKING TEXAS" while the specimen shows the mark 
incorporated into the phrase "I'M ON MY WAY TO ALBERT FREAKIN' TEXAS" and with an 
apostrophe instead of the "G". Applicant has thus failed to provide the required evidence of use of the 
mark in commerce. See TMEP §807.12(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) for each 
applicable international class that (a) shows the mark in the drawing in actual use in 
commerce for the goods and/or services in the application or amendment to allege use, and 
(b) was in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or 
prior to the filing of an amendment to allege use.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(2)        Submit a request to amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section1(b) (which includes withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no 
specimen is required before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) 
and filing requirements such as providing a specimen.
 
The USPTO will not accept an amended drawing submitted in response to this refusal because the 
changes would materially alter the drawing of the mark in the original application or as previously 
acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b); TMEP §807.14. Specifically, adding the wording "I'M 
ON MY WAY TO" would change the impression to be a phrase indicating a person's actions.
 
For more information about drawings and instructions on how to satisfy these response options using 
the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Drawing webpage.
 
4.         Applicant's Domicile Address Required 
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record identifies 
“c/o” or in “care of” another party’s address and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal 
place of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). 
The application lists the same address for the applicant and the attorney of record, and the attached 
from https://haylegal.com/contact-us/ shows that the address "611 W 5th St Suite 300 Austin TX 
78701" is the address of The Hay Legal Group, PLLC. A domicile address must identify either (1) the 
permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an individual applicant resides and intends to be 
the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal place of business, which is the juristic applicant’s 
headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  
See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a). All applications must include the applicant’s domicile 
address, which is required for a complete application. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.22(a)(1), 2.32(a)(2), 2.189.
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile 
as “c/o” or in “care of” another party’s address. In most cases, an address that is listed as “c/o” or in 
“care of” another party’s address is not acceptable as a domicile address because it does not identify the 
location of applicant’s headquarters where the entity’s senior executives or officers ordinarily direct 
and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1).
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide (1) documentation showing that the listed 
address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that applicant has no 
fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §601.01(b)-(b)(1).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s domicile address. Applicant should provide the 
most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119779
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
