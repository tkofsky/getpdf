2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks

SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Written Consent - Name of Individual
•
Identification of Goods and/or Services
•
 
 
Written Consent - Clarification
 
In the application as filed, the applicant provides a written consent that consents to the use and 
registration of applicant's professional name "for the goods in the application."  However, it appears 
that the identification may also include services that applicant seeks to register.  If applicant is 
providing services, then a new written consent must be submitted. 
 
To register a mark that consists of or comprises the name of a particular living individual, including a 
first name, pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, an applicant must provide a written consent 
personally signed by the named individual. 15 U.S.C. §1052(c); TMEP §§813, 1206.04(a).
 
The applicant may use the following in submitting a new consent:
 
(1)        A written consent, personally signed by the named individual(s), as follows: 
“I, Matthew Bell, consent to the use and registration of my name, KING MATTA, as a 
trademark and/or service mark with the USPTO.”
 
For an overview of the requirements for names appearing in marks, and instructions on how to satisfy 
this requirement using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see 
the Name/Portrait/Signature of Particular Living Individual in Mark webpage.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
Identification of Goods and/or Services - Clarification Required - Class 009
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “Entertainment services in the nature of online musical 
performances by a professional entertainer, namely a musical artist; Entertainment services in the 
nature of non-downloadable musical performances by a professional entertainer, namely a musical 
artist” in the identification of goods and/or services in International Class 009 because it is indefinite 
and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite 
because it does not make clear what the goods and/or services are. Further, this wording could identify 
goods and/or services in more than one international class. For example, digital music downloadablefrom the Internet is in International Class 009 and entertainment services in the nature of live musical 
performances are in International Class 041.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:
 
"[insert clarification of "Entertainment services in the nature of online musical performances by a 
professional entertainer, namely a musical artist," e.g., Digital music downloadable from the Internet 
featuring musical performances by a musical artist], in International Class 009."
 
“Entertainment services in the nature of live musical performances by a professional entertainer, 
namely a musical artist; [insert clarification of "Entertainment services in the nature of online musical 
performances by a professional entertainer, namely a musical artist," e.g., Entertainment services in 
the nature of providing a website featuring non-downloadable audio recordings by a musical artist in 
the field of musical performances]; Entertainment services in the nature of [insert clarification of "non-
downloadable musical performances by a professional entertainer, namely a musical artist," e.g., 
providing online non-downloadable visual and audio recordings by a musical artist in the field of 
musical performances], in International Class 041.”
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
Additional Classes
 
The application identifies goods and/or services that are classified in at least two (2) classes; however, 
applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only one (1) class. In a multiple-class application, a fee for 
each class is required. 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a)(2), (b)(2); TMEP §§810.01, 1403.01. For more information 
about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
Therefore, applicant must either (1) restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees 
already paid, or (2) submit the fees for each additional class.
 
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.
 
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) 
already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). 
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for class 041; and applicant needs a specimen for class 009. See more 
information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or 
advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce 
on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as 
early as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(a) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
