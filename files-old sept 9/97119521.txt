Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusals - Partial Refusals 
 
THIS PARTIAL REFUSAL APPLIES ONLY TO THE GOODS SPECIFIED THEREIN "Babies' 
bottles; Breast pumps; Disposable feeding bottle teats; Feeding bottle teats; Feeding bottle valves; 
Pacifiers for babies; Teething rings"
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 3410276 and 5924867. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark KINGKIDS in standard characters for, in relevant part, 
“Babies' bottles; Breast pumps; Disposable feeding bottle teats; Feeding bottle teats; Feeding bottle 
valves; Pacifiers for babies; Teething rings” in International Class 010.
 
Registrant’s mark, Registration No. 3410276, is KING'S KIDS in standard characters for “clothing, 
namely, t-shirts, sweatshirts, shorts, pants, sweatpants, jackets, hats, caps and footwear” in International 
Class 025. 
 
Registrant’s mark, Registration No. 5924867, is KIDS KING in standard characters for, in relevant 
part, “Plush toys” in International Class 028. 
 
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Here, applicant’s mark, KINGKIDS, is confusingly similar to the registered marks, KING'S KIDS and 
KIDS KING. 
 
The compared marks are identical except for a slight difference in appearance between applicant’s 
mark, which appears as a compound word with no space separating the words, that is, KINGKIDS; and 
Registration No. 3410276, which appears as multiple words with space separating the words, that is, 
KING'S KIDS. As such, the marks are identical in sound and virtually identical in appearance, and are 
thus confusingly similar for the purposes of determining likelihood of confusion. See, e.g., Seaguard 
Corp. v. Seaward Int’l, Inc., 223 USPQ 48, 51 (TTAB 1984) (“[T]he marks ‘SEAGUARD’ and ‘SEA 
GUARD’ are, in contemplation of law, identical [internal citation omitted].”); In re Best W. Family 
Steak House, Inc., 222 USPQ 827, 827 (TTAB 1984) (“There can be little doubt that the marks 
[BEEFMASTER and BEEF MASTER] are practically identical”); Stock Pot, Inc., v. Stockpot Rest., 
Inc., 220 USPQ 52, 52 (TTAB 1983), aff’d 737 F.2d 1576, 222 USPQ 665 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (“There is 
no question that the marks of the parties [STOCKPOT and STOCK POT] are confusingly similar. The 
word marks are phonetically identical and visually almost identical.”).Moreover, the ending of the first portion of Registration No. 3410276 includes an apostrophe and letter 
“s.” This additional matter has little, if any, trademark significance and does not otherwise affect the 
overall similarity of the marks in terms of commercial impression. See In re Binion, 93 USPQ2d 1531, 
1534 (TTAB 2009) (noting that “[t]he absence of the possessive form in applicant’s mark . . . has little, 
if any, significance for consumers in distinguishing it from the cited mark”); In re Curtice-Burns, Inc., 
231 USPQ 990, 992 (TTAB 1986) (finding the marks McKENZIE’S and McKENZIE “virtually 
identical in commercial impression”); Winn’s Stores, Inc. v. Hi-Lo, Inc., 203 USPQ 140, 143 (TTAB 
1979) (noting that “little if any trademark significance can be attributed to the apostrophe and the letter 
‘s’ in opposer’s mark”).
 
Applicant's mark and Registration No. 3410276 are pronounced nearly identically, despite their slight 
differences in appearance.  However, slight differences in the sound of similar marks will not avoid a 
likelihood of confusion. In re Energy Telecomms. & Elec. Ass’n, 222 USPQ 350, 351 (TTAB 1983); 
see In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1367, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1912 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  The marks 
therefore not only look similar, but sound similar, meaning they have similar overall commercial 
impressions. 
 
In addition, confusion is likely between two marks consisting of reverse combinations of the same 
elements if they convey the same meaning or create substantially similar commercial impressions. 
TMEP §1207.01(b)(vii); see, e.g., In re Wine Soc’y of Am. Inc., 12 USPQ2d 1139, 1142 (TTAB 1989) 
(holding THE WINE SOCIETY OF AMERICA and design for wine club membership services 
including the supplying of printed materials likely to be confused with AMERICAN WINE SOCIETY 
1967 and design for newsletters, bulletins, and journals); In re Nationwide Indus. Inc., 6 USPQ2d 1882, 
1884 (TTAB 1988) (holding RUST BUSTER for a rust-penetrating spray lubricant likely to be 
confused with BUST RUST for a penetrating oil).  In the present case, applicant's mark and 
Registration No. 5924867 consist of the same elements, which are merely transposed: applicant's mark 
is KINGKIDS, while Registration No. 5924867 is KIDS KING.  The marks thus look similar and 
create similar overall commercial impressions. 
 
Because the marks look and sound similar and create the same commercial impression, the marks are 
considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes. 
 
Relatedness of the Goods and/or Services 
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).Here, applicant’s goods, “Babies' bottles; Breast pumps; Disposable feeding bottle teats; Feeding bottle 
teats; Feeding bottle valves; Pacifiers for babies; Teething rings,” are closely related to registrants' 
goods, “clothing, namely, t-shirts, sweatshirts, shorts, pants, sweatpants, jackets, hats, caps and 
footwear” and “plush toys.”
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots from Smudgical, The Tot, and buybuyBaby, 
establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant goods and 
markets the goods under the same mark and that the relevant goods are sold or provided through the 
same trade channels and used by the same classes of consumers in the same fields of use. Thus, 
applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are considered related for likelihood of confusion 
purposes. See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re 
Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Accordingly, the goods and/or services are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of 
confusion analysis. 
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods and/or services are related, there is a likelihood of 
confusion as to the source of applicant’s goods and/or services, and registration is refused pursuant to 
Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.
 
Response Options to Refusals 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
Valid Domicile Address Required
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record is for a 
third-party commercial mail receiving agency and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal 
place of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). 
A domicile address must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place 
an individual applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal 
place of business, which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile 
address as follows: 300 Leonora St. #1430, Seattle, WA 98121-2411. This address has been identified 
as a commercial mail receiving agency by the U.S. Postal Service Coding Accuracy Support System 
(CASS) and thus does not appear to be applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1). 
Commercial mail receiving agencies are private businesses that accept mail from the U.S. Postal 
Service on behalf of third parties.
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide (1) documentation showing that the listed 
U.S. domicile address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting thatapplicant has no fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §§601.01(b)-(b)(1), 803.05(a).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s U.S. domicile address. Applicant should provide 
the most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP 
§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.
