action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
 
INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R.§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 6261288 (NEATNESSOME).  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 
see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registration.
 
The Applicant’s mark is NEATNESS (+styl.) for "Bottle openers, electric and non-electric; Cleaning 
brushes for household use; Containers for household or kitchen use not of precious metal; Containers 
for household or kitchen use of precious metal; Drinking bottles for sports; Garbage cans; Household 
containers for foods; Household utensils, namely, graters; Ice cube trays; Insulated containers for food 
or beverages; Insulated mugs; Mixing bowls; Non-electric ice crushers; Non-electric rotary cheese 
graters; Salad spinners; Salt and pepper shakers; Shower racks; Step trash cans".
 
The Registrant’s mark is NEATNESSOME (+styl.) for "Baskets for household purposes; Baskets for 
waste paper littering for household purposes; Baskets of wicker for household purposes; Baskets of 
wood for household purposes; Baskets of metal for household purposes; Baskets of cloth for household 
purposes; Buckets of woven fabric; Collapsible fabric storage container for domestic use; Flower 
baskets; Laundry baskets; Laundry bins for domestic or household use; Laundry bins for household 
purposes; Laundry hampers for domestic or household use; Plant baskets; Waste baskets; Waste paper 
baskets".
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that so resembles a registered mark 
that it is likely a potential consumer would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the source of the 
goods of the applicant and registrant.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  A determination of likelihood of 
confusion under Section 2(d) is made on a case-by-case basis and the factors set forth in In re E. I. du 
Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) aid in this 
determination.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d 1344, 1349, 98 USPQ2d 1253, 
1256 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citing On-Line Careline, Inc. v. Am. Online, Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1085, 56 
USPQ2d 1471, 1474 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).  Not all the du Pont factors, however, are necessarily relevant or 
of equal weight, and any one of the factors may control in a given case, depending upon the evidence of 
record.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d at 1355, 98 USPQ2d at 1260; In re 
Majestic Distilling Co., 315 F.3d 1311, 1315, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see In re E. I. 
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d at 1361-62, 177 USPQ at 567.
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant:  similarity of the marks, similarity and nature 
of the goods, and similarity of the trade channels of the goods.  See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 
1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Dakin’s Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d 1593, 
1595-96 (TTAB 1999); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
COMPARISON OF THE MARKS
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marksconfusingly similar.”  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Applicant's mark is NEATNESS (+styl.).
 
Registrant's mark is NEATNESSOME (+styl.).
 
In this case, both marks feature the common wording "NEATNESS".  Marks may be confusingly 
similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the 
compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 
USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly 
similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and 
CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
The entirety of applicant's mark is encompassed by the registered mark.  Incorporating the entirety of 
one mark within another does not obviate the similarity between the compared marks, as in the present 
case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d). See Wella Corp. v. Cal. 
Concept Corp., 558 F.2d 1019, 1022, 194 USPQ 419, 422 (C.C.P.A. 1977) (holding CALIFORNIA 
CONCEPT and surfer design and CONCEPT confusingly similar); Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. 
Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106 (C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL 
LANCER and design and BENGAL confusingly similar); Double Coin Holdings, Ltd. v. Tru Dev., 
2019 USPQ2d 377409, at *6-7 (TTAB 2019) (holding ROAD WARRIOR and WARRIOR (stylized) 
confusingly similar); In re Mr. Recipe, LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1084, 1090 (TTAB 2016) (holding JAWS 
DEVOUR YOUR HUNGER and JAWS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii). In the present 
case, the marks are identical in part.  
 
Although applicant’s mark does not contain the entirety of the registered mark, applicant’s mark is 
likely to appear to prospective purchasers as a shortened form of registrant’s mark. See In re Mighty 
Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting United States Shoe 
Corp., 229 USPQ 707, 709 (TTAB 1985)). Thus, merely omitting some of the wording from a 
registered mark may not overcome a likelihood of confusion. See In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 
1342, 94 USPQ2d 1257; In re Optica Int’l, 196 USPQ 775, 778 (TTAB 1977); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-
(iii). In this case, applicant’s mark does not create a distinct commercial impression from the registered 
mark because it contains the common wording "NEATNESS", but does not add any wording that 
would distinguish it from the registered mark.
 
Furthermore, where the goods of an applicant and registrant are legally identical, the degree of 
similarity between the marks required to support a finding that confusion is likely declines. See Cai v. 
Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting In re 
Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
COMPARISON OF THE GOODS
 
The goods are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).  The compared goods need 
not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. 
Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 
F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only be 
“related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding their marketing are such that they 
could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., 
Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods stated in the application 
and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 
F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 
1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the application uses broad wording to describe its containers for household or kitchen use 
and garbage cans, which presumably encompasses all goods of the type described, including 
registrant’s narrower baskets for household purposes, collapsible fabric storage container for domestic 
use, and buckets of woven fabric, and waste baskets.  See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 
USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 
(TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills 
Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. 
Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 
USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
The remaining goods are a variety of related household goods. 
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods, but to 
protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer.  
See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  Therefore, any 
doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the registrant.  TMEP 
§1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1265, 62 USPQ2d 
1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 
1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
In light of the similarities between the marks and the relatedness of the goods, it is likely that 
consumers who encounter the parties' goods will falsely conclude that they originate from the same 
source.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action.  
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action.  See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.  The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails 
can be used for informal communications and are included in the application record.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(c), 2.191; TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.
