below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application

Issue date:  August 24, 2022
Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues 
 
Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
•
Identification of Goods and Services – Amendment Required 
•
Foreign Registration Required
•
 
Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Identification of Goods and Services – Amendment Required 
 
The wording “tissue dispensers” and "retail and online store services featuring sale of tissue box 
holders and tissue dispensers" in the identification of goods and services is indefinite and must be 
clarified because tissue dispensers does not specify what kind of tissue. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.01.  
 
In addition, the wording “online store services featuring sale of tissue box holders and tissue 
dispensers” in the identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because it does not 
specify the type of online store services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.  
 
Moreover, applicant must correct the punctuation in the identification to clarify the individual items in 
the list of goods and/or services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01(a). Proper punctuation in 
identifications is necessary to delineate explicitly each product or service within a list and to avoid 
ambiguity. Commas, semicolons, and apostrophes are the only punctuation that should be used in an 
identification of goods and/or services. TMEP §1402.01(a). An applicant should not use colons, 
periods, exclamation points, and question marks in an identification. Id. In addition, applicants should 
not use symbols in the identification such as asterisks (*), at symbols (@), or carets. Id.
 
In general, commas should be used in an identification (1) to separate a series of related items 
identified within a particular category of goods or services, (2) before and after “namely,” and (3) 
between each item in a list of goods or services following “namely” (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion, bar soap, shampoo). Id. Semicolons generally should be used to separate a series 
of distinct categories of goods or services within an international class (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion; deodorizers for pets; glass cleaners). Id. Thus, applicant should delete the periods 
that appear in the identification of goods and services.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:
 
International Class 21: Tissue box holders; facial tissue dispensers
•
 
International Class 35: Retail and online {specify the type of online store services, e.g., retail, 
wholesale, etc.} store services featuring sale of tissue box holders and facial tissue dispensers 
•
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broadenor expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e). 
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Foreign Registration Required
 
The application specifies both an intent to use basis under Trademark Act Section 1(b) and a claim of 
priority under Section 44(d) based on a foreign application. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 1126(d); 37 
C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2), (a)(4). However, no copy of a foreign registration has been provided even though 
the application indicates applicant’s intent to rely on Section 44(e) as an additional basis for 
registration. See 15 U.S.C. §1126(e).
 
An application with a Section 44(e) basis must include a true copy, photocopy, certification, or certified 
copy of a foreign registration from an applicant’s country of origin. 15 U.S.C. §1126(e); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §§1004, 1004.01, 1016. In addition, an applicant’s country of origin must be a 
party to a convention or treaty relating to trademarks to which the United States is also a party, or must 
extend reciprocal registration rights to nationals of the United States by law. 15 U.S.C. §1126(b); 
TMEP §§1002.01, 1004.
 
Therefore, applicant must provide a copy of the foreign registration from applicant’s country of origin 
when it becomes available. TMEP §1003.04(a). A copy of a foreign registration must consist of a 
document issued to an applicant by, or certified by, the intellectual property office in applicant’s 
country of origin. TMEP §1004.01. If applicant’s country of origin does not issue registrations or 
Madrid Protocol certificates of extension of protection, applicant may submit a copy of the Madrid 
Protocol international registration that shows that protection of the international registration has been 
extended to applicant’s country of origin. TMEP §1016. In addition, applicant must also provide an 
English translation if the foreign registration is not written in English. 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP 
§1004.01(a)-(b). The translation should be signed by the translator. TMEP §1004.01(b).
 
If the foreign registration has not yet issued, or applicant requires additional time to procure a copy of 
the foreign registration (and English translation, as appropriate), applicant should so inform the 
trademark examining attorney and request that the U.S. application be suspended until a copy of the 
foreign registration is available. TMEP §§716.02(b), 1003.04(b).
 
If applicant cannot satisfy the requirements of a Section 44(e) basis, applicant may request that the 
mark be approved for publication based solely on the Section 1(b) basis. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 
1126(e); 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §§806.02(f), 806.04(b), 1003.04(b). Although the mark may be 
approved for publication on the Section 1(b) basis, it will not register until an acceptable allegation of 
use has been filed. See 15 U.S.C. §1051(c)-(d); 37 C.F.R. §§2.76, 2.88; TMEP §1103. Please note that, 
if the U.S. application satisfied the requirements of Section 44(d) as of the U.S. application filing date, 
applicant may retain the priority filing date under Section 44(d) without perfecting the Section 44(e) 
basis, provided there is a continuing valid basis for registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(3)-(4); TMEP 
§§806.02(f), 806.04(b).
 
Alternatively, applicant has the option to amend the application to rely solely on the Section 44(e) basisand request deletion of the Section 1(b) basis. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §806.04. The foreign 
registration alone may serve as the basis for obtaining a U.S. registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3); 
TMEP §806.01(d).
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
