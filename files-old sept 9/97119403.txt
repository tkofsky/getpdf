Mark:  HYKOLITY
Correspondence Address:

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark(s) in 
U.S. Registration No(s). 5259281.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq.  See the enclosed registration(s).
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that so resembles a registered mark 
that it is likely a potential consumer would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the source of the 
goods and/or services of the applicant and registrant.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  A determination of 
likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d) is made on a case-by case basis and the factors set forth in 
In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 177 USPQ 563 (C.C.P.A. 1973) aid in this 
determination.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d 1344, 1349, 98 USPQ2d 1253, 
1256 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citing On-Line Careline, Inc. v. Am. Online, Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1085, 56 
USPQ2d 1471, 1474 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).  Not all the du Pont factors, however, are necessarily relevant or 
of equal weight, and any one of the factors may control in a given case, depending upon the evidence of 
record.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d at 1355, 98 USPQ2d at 1260; In re 
Majestic Distilling Co., 315 F.3d 1311, 1315, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see In re E. I. 
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d at 1361-62, 177 USPQ at 567.
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant:  similarity of the marks, similarity and nature 
of the goods and/or services, and similarity of the trade channels of the goods and/or services.  See In re 
Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Dakin’s 
Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d 1593, 1595-96 (TTAB 1999); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
For the reasons discussed below, the examining attorney concludes that confusion as to the source of 
goods and/or services is likely between the applicant’s mark HYKOLITY, for Lampshades; Arc lamps; 
Electric lamps; Flashlights; Incandescent lamps; Lamp shades; Lamps; Light bulbs; Electric bulbs; 
LED lamps, and the registrant's mark HYKOLITY, and design, for  Flood lights; LED and HID light 
fixtures; LED candles; LED flashlights; LED flood lights and LED work lights for construction 
settings; LED lamps; LED landscape lights; LED light apparatus that clips on to a handbag, used to 
illuminate a handbag; LED light assemblies for street lights, signs, commercial lighting, automobiles, 
buildings, and other architectural uses; LED light bulbs; LED light machines; LED light strips for 
decorative purposes; LED lighting fixtures for indoor and outdoor lighting applications; LED lights for 
lighting purposes incorporated into key chains, small toys or other similar personal items; LED lights 
for strings, flowers, branches and other ornamental decorations; LED luminaires; LED mood lights; 
LED strobe lights to be placed on public safety vehicles; LED underwater lights; Light bulbs; Ceiling 
light fittings; Electric light bulbs; Fixtures for incandescent light bulbs; Fluorescent electric light 
bulbs; Halogen light bulbs; LED (light emitting diode) lighting fixtures; Optical lens covers that 
improve light output and uniformity and protect the LED, sold as a feature of an LED lighting system; 
Tools, components and supplies for use in making signs, namely, fluorescent, HID, LED and 
incandescent bulbs, lamps and fixtures.Comparison of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F. 3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014) (citing In re White Swan 
Ltd., 8 USPQ2d 1534, 1535 (TTAB 1988); In re 1st USA Realty Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
  
In this case, the marks all consist of, or include, the same distinctive and dominant term 
“HYKOLITY.” 
 
The registered mark includes additional minor design matter and a stylized font.  However, the applied-
for mark appears in standard characters and could be rendered in a manner similar or identical to that of 
the registered mark.  A mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in any lettering style; the 
rights reside in the wording or other literal element and not in any particular display or rendition. See In 
re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 
601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. §2.52(a); TMEP 
§1207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a mark presented in stylized characters and/or with a design element generally 
will not avoid likelihood of confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters because the word 
portion could be presented in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 
101 USPQ2d at 1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 
1983) (stating that “the argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable where one party 
asserts rights in no particular display”). 
 
Comparison of the Goods and/or Services
 
The goods and/or services of the parties need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood 
of confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 
1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 
2000) (“[E]ven if the goods in question are different from, and thus not related to, one another in kind, 
the same goods can be related in the mind of the consuming public as to the origin of the goods.”); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). 
 
The respective goods and/or services need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing [be] such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Additionally, a likelihood of confusion determination is based on the description of the goods and/or 
services stated in the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See 
In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the parties' goods both include light bulbs and LED lamps.  Further, the applicant's "Arc 
lamps; Electric lamps; Flashlights; Incandescent lamps, lamps, and electric bulbs," encompass one ormore of the following goods covered in the registration:   "LED and HID light fixtures; LED 
flashlights; Electric light bulbs; Fixtures for incandescent light bulbs; Tools, components and supplies 
for use in making signs, namely, fluorescent, HID, LED and incandescent bulbs, lamps and fixtures."  
See attached evidence from Wikipedia.org (accessed 8/24/2022) indicating HID lamps are types of arc 
lamps.  As such, the parties' goods overlap with each other and are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills 
Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. 
Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 
USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods and/or services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of 
trade, or classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same 
class of purchasers.” In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
Finally, applicant's lamp shades are closely related to the various lamps and lighting fixtures identified 
by both parties because such goods commonly share the same channels of trade.  See attached evidence 
from https://gaylordslampandshade.com/, https://www.lampsunlimitedmclean.com/, 
and https://www.shadesoflight.com/ (all accessed 8/24/2022).
 
For the reasons discussed above, registration must be refused under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
