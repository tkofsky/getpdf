Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant

2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Likelihood of confusion refusal--partial
•
Prior pending application--partial
•
 
THE FOLLOWING PARTIAL REFUSAL APPLIES ONLY TO THE SERVICES SPECIFIED 
THEREIN: "retail store services featuring . . . alcohol, namely, beer, wine, and liquor"
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration No. 3674103.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registration. 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”).  In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.”  In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in anylikelihood of confusion analysis:  (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services.  See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.  
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or 
services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer.  See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
 Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the 
registrant.  TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
The applicant’s mark is HOOK'D for "retail store services featuring . . . alcohol, namely, beer, wine, 
and liquor."  The registrant's mark is HOOKED for wine.
 
The marks are highly similar in this case.  The marks are essentially phonetic equivalents and thus 
sound similar. Similarity in sound alone may be sufficient to support a finding that the compared marks 
are confusingly similar. In re 1st USA Realty Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007) 
(citing Krim-Ko Corp. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 390 F.2d 728, 732, 156 USPQ 523, 526 (C.C.P.A. 
1968)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iv). 
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The goods/services are related in this case.  The applicant provides retail store services featuring 
alcohol including wine and the registrant provides wine.  The use of similar marks on or in connection 
with both products and retail-store services has been held likely to cause confusion where the evidence 
showed that the retail-store services featured the same type of products. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 
903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding the use of similar marks for 
various clothing items, including athletic uniforms, and for retail shops featuring sports team related 
clothing and apparel likely to cause confusion); In re Country Oven, Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 443903, at *12 
(TTAB 2019) (holding the use of identical marks for bread buns and retail bakery stores and shops 
likely to cause confusion); In re House Beer, LLC, 114 USPQ2d 1073, 1078 (TTAB 2015) (holding the 
use of identical marks for beer and for retail store services featuring beer likely to cause confusion);TMEP §1207.01(a)(ii).  The applicant's retail stores may feature the registrant's wine.  Consumers are 
likely to be confused as to the source of the goods/services when they encounter the goods/services 
bearing the marks because they are likely to believe that the goods/services emanate from the same 
source.
 
The trademark examining attorney has attached evidence from the USPTO’s X-Search database 
consisting of a number of third-party marks registered for use in connection with the same or similar 
goods and/or services as those of both applicant and registrant in this case.  This evidence shows that 
the goods and/or services listed therein are of a kind that may emanate from a single source under a 
single mark.  See In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 1730, 1737 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Infinity Broad. 
Corp., 60 USPQ2d 1214, 1217-18 (TTAB 2001); In re Albert Trostel & Sons Co., 29 USPQ2d 1783, 
1785-86 (TTAB 1993); In re Mucky Duck Mustard Co., 6 USPQ2d 1467, 1470 n.6 (TTAB 1988)); 
TMEP §1207.01(d)(iii).
 
In addition, the attached Internet evidence, consisting of excerpted representative articles from the 
internet, establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant 
goods and/or services, markets the goods and/or services under the same mark, and the relevant goods 
and/or services are sold or provided through the same trade channels and used by the same classes of 
consumers in the same fields of use.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are 
considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 
USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 
1271-72 (TTAB 2009).  Retailers provide their private label wines and alcohol, and consumers are 
likely to be confused as to the source of the goods/services.
 
Please note any differences in the goods and/or services of the parties is not controlling in determining 
likelihood of confusion. The issue is not likelihood of confusion between particular goods and/or 
services, but likelihood of confusion as to the source or sponsorship of those goods and/or services. 
In re Majestic Distilling Co., 315 F.3d 1311, 1316, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1205 (Fed. Cir. 2003); In re Shell 
Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 1993); TMEP §1207.01. 
 
The goods/services travel in the same channels of trade.  Or, the conditions surrounding their marketing 
may be such, that they could be encountered by the same purchasers under circumstances that could 
give rise to the mistaken belief that the goods/services come from a common source.
 
The similarities among the mark and the goods/services of the parties are so great as to create a 
likelihood of confusion.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL PARTIAL REFUSAL APPLIES ONLY TO THE SERVICES 
SPECIFIED THEREIN: "retail store services featuring smoking products and smoking supplies, 
cigarettes, vaping products and vaping supplies" 
 
Application Not Entitled to Registration—One Earlier-filed Application
 
In addition, the filing date of pending Application Serial No. 90872600 precedes applicant’s filing 
date.  See attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, 
applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihoodof confusion between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  
Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be 
suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.

Gerald L. RobertsonUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120314
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
