Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Identification of Goods and Services – Amendment Required 
 
Applicant must clarify the wording in the identification of goods and services in International Class 041 
because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This 
wording is indefinite because it is unclear what the underlying nature of the goods and services are. For 
example, it is unclear whether "music creation" refers to production or composition. Further, the 
wording in the identification could identify goods and services in more than one international class. For 
example, the wording "merchandise such as" could include items ranging from CDs in International 
Class 009 to ornamental novelty buttons in International Class 026. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
International Class 009: Compact discs featuring music; Pre-recorded vinyl records featuring 
music
•
International Class 014: Ornamental lapel pins
•
International Class 016: Posters made of paper
•
International Class 025: Clothing, namely, ________ {applicant to specify here clothing type; 
e.g., shirts, hats, shoes, etc.} 
•
International Class 026: Ornamental novelty buttons
•
International Class 041: Music production services; music composition for others; Entertainment 
services in the nature of recording, production and post-production services in the field of 
music; Entertainment, namely, live music concerts; Entertainment services by a musical artist 
and producer, namely, musical composition for others and production of musical sound 
recordings; Entertainment services in the nature of live visual and audio performances by a 
musical artist
•
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e). 
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.Multiple Class Application Requirements for a Section 1(b) Application 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee already 
paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). The application identifies goods and/or 
services that are classified in at least six classes; however, applicant submitted a 
fee sufficient for only one class. Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes 
not covered by the submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes 
covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
Applicant should note the following additional requirement.
 
Mark Description -- Amendment Required 
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one uses broad, vague 
language that does not accurately describe the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. 
Descriptions must be accurate and identify all the literal and design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.37; TMEP §808.02. In this case, the description is vague because it is unclear what "written on 
stack" means and whether the hand forming the letter "V" is in addition to or part of the stylized literal 
elements.
 
Additionally, applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one is 
incomplete and does not describe all the significant aspects of the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP 
§§808.01, 808.02. Descriptions must be accurate and identify all the literal and design elements in the 
mark. See 37 C.F.R. §2.37; TMEP §§808 et seq.  
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate: The mark consists of a skeletal hand forming the 
letter "V" beside the stylized lettering "IOLENT DAWN". "IOLENT" is presented stacked 
above "DAWN". Inside the letter "D" is a crescent moon.

notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
