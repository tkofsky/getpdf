SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Disclaimer Required
•
Explanation of Mark's Significance Required
•
 
Real estate management services; Real estate financing services; Real estate agency services; Real 
estate title insurance underwriting services; Insurance brokerage services; Insurance consultancy; Life 
insurance brokerage; Real estate brokerage; Insurance consulting in the field of life insurance 
 
Disclaimer Required 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “CALI AGENT” because it is merely descriptive and primarily 
geographically descriptive of applicant's services.
 
The wording “AGENT” merely describes a function and feature of applicant's services. See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
 
The attached evidence from the Collins dictionary shows this wording means "a person or thing that 
performs an action or brings about a certain result, or that is able to do so or a person, firm, etc. 
empowered to act for another". In addition, evidence from The Hartford, Insureon, and Yelp shows the 
wording AGENT is commonly used in connection with similar services to describe professionals that 
represent buyers or sellers in real estate transactions or insurers. Therefore, this wording merely 
describes that the real estate and insurance services in the application are performed by an agent. 
 
In addition, the wording “CALI” is primarily geographically descriptive of the origin of applicant’s 
goods and/or services. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); In re Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel 
S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1451-52 (Fed. Cir. 1987); TMEP §§1210.01(a), 1210.06(a), 
1213.03(a).
 
The attached evidence from shows that the term "CALI" in the mark refers to the state of California, a 
generally known geographic place or location. See TMEP §§1210.02 et seq.  The services for whichapplicant seeks registration originate in this geographic place or location as shown by the applicant's 
address. in the application. See TMEP §1210.03. Because the services originate in this place or 
location, a public association of the goods and/or services with the place is presumed. See In re 
Hollywood Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 1852, 1858 (TTAB 2014) (citing In re Spirits of New 
Merced, LLC, 85 USPQ2d 1614, 1621 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §§1210.02(a) 1210.04.Thus, the primary 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “CALI AGENT” apart from the mark as 
shown.
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
 
Explanation of Mark's Significance Required 
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must explain whether the term “222” in the 
mark has any significance in the real estate or insurance trade or industry or as applied to applicant’s  
services, or if such wording is a term of art within applicant’s industry. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP 
§814. If the wording has no significance and is not a term of art in the relevant trade or industry or as 
used with applicant’s  services, applicant must provide a statement to that effect. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.61(b); TMEP §814.
 
To respond to this requirement for information, open the appropriate Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS) response form and enter the serial number, answer “yes” to question 3, and provide the 
information on the “Additional Statement(s)” page in the “Significance of Wording, Letter(s), or 
Numeral(s)” text box(es) in the form.
 
Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an independent ground for refusing 
registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 (TTAB 2021) (citing In re 
Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 
1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).

Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
