SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 5401684 and 5406620.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”).  In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.”  In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis:  (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services.  See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01. 
 
The applied-for mark is STARSEED COMMODITIES, INC. with a design element for “On-line retail 
store services featuring natural goods including health and beauty products and e-books” in 
International Class 35.
 
The registered marks are
 
U.S. Registration No. 5401684: STARSEED with a design element for “Nutritional, dietary and food 
supplements ;Nutritional meal replacements, namely, drink mixes, meal replacement bars, meal 
replacement powders, ready to drink meal replacement beverages and nutritional supplement, proteindietary supplements, namely, sacha inchi protein food fortifications, namely, nutritional food 
supplements for enriching foods and beverages derived from nuts, seeds and herbs; protein powders for 
human consumption for use as a food additive; Protein supplements; Nutritional supplement shakes; 
Dietary supplements; Vitamin supplements; ground sacha inchi seed fiber for use as a dietary 
supplement” in International Class 5. 
 
U.S. Registration No. 5406620: STARSEED in standard characters for “Nutritional, dietary and food 
supplements; Nutritional meal replacements, namely, drink mixes, meal replacement bars, meal 
replacement powders, ready to drink meal replacement beverages and nutritional supplement; protein 
dietary supplements, namely, sacha inchi protein; food fortifications, namely, nutritional food 
supplements for enriching foods and beverages derived from nuts, seeds and herbs; protein powders for 
human consumption for use as a food additive; Protein supplements; Nutritional supplement shakes; 
Dietary supplements; Vitamin supplements; ground sacha inchi seed fiber for use as a dietary 
supplement” in International Class 5. 
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.” 
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b). The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks. In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 
(TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP 
§1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 
2014).
 
When evaluating a composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is normally 
accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be 
remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods and/or services. In re 
Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks 
must be compared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is 
accorded greater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word 
portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant 
Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 
1983)).In this case, the word portion of the compared marks is STARSEED COMMODITIES, INC. and 
STARSEED. Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more 
significant or dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 
41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Matter that is descriptive 
of or generic for a party’s goods and/or services is typically less significant or less dominant in relation 
to other wording in a mark. See Anheuser-Busch, LLC v. Innvopak Sys. Pty Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1816, 
1824-25 (TTAB 2015) (citing In re Chatam Int’l Inc., 380 F.3d 1340, 1342-43, 71 USPQ2d 1944, 1946 
(Fed. Cir. 2004)).  
 
As further explained below, the wording "COMMODITIES, INC." in the applied-for mark is merely 
descriptive of or generic for applicant’s services. Thus, this wording is less significant in terms of 
affecting the mark’s commercial impression, and renders the wording STARSEED the more dominant 
element of the mark.
 
Incorporating the entirety of one mark within another does not obviate the similarity between the 
compared marks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 
2(d). See Wella Corp. v. Cal. Concept Corp., 558 F.2d 1019, 1022, 194 USPQ 419, 422 (C.C.P.A. 
1977) (holding CALIFORNIA CONCEPT and surfer design and CONCEPT confusingly similar); 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106 
(C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL LANCER and design and BENGAL confusingly similar); Double 
Coin Holdings, Ltd. v. Tru Dev., 2019 USPQ2d 377409, at *6-7 (TTAB 2019) (holding ROAD 
WARRIOR and WARRIOR (stylized) confusingly similar); In re Mr. Recipe, LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1084, 
1090 (TTAB 2016) (holding JAWS DEVOUR YOUR HUNGER and JAWS confusingly similar); 
TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii). In the present case, the marks are identical in part.
 
Because the marks look similar and create the same commercial impression, the marks are considered 
similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.
 
Relatedness of the Goods and Services
 
The goods and services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or 
travel in the same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
Consumers are likely to be confused by the use of similar marks on or in connection with goods and 
with services featuring or related to those goods. TMEP §1207.01(a)(ii); see In re Detroit Athletic Co., 
903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding retail shops featuring sports 
team related clothing and apparel related to various clothing items, including athletic uniforms); In re 
Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 6 USPQ2d 1025 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (finding retail grocery and 
general merchandise store services related to furniture); In re United Serv. Distribs., Inc., 229 USPQ 
237 (TTAB 1986) (finding distributorship services in the field of health and beauty aids related to skin 
cream); In re Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., 228 USPQ 949 (TTAB 1986) (finding various items of 
men’s, boys’, girls’ and women’s clothing related to restaurant services and towels); Steelcase Inc. v. 
Steelcare Inc., 219 USPQ 433 (TTAB 1983) (finding refinishing of furniture, office furniture, and 
machinery related to office furniture and accessories); Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Huskie Freightways, Inc., 
177 USPQ 32 (TTAB 1972) (finding trucking services related to motor trucks and buses).The use of similar marks on or in connection with both products and retail-store services has been held 
likely to cause confusion where the evidence showed that the retail-store services featured the same 
type of products. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. 
Cir. 2018) (holding the use of similar marks for various clothing items, including athletic uniforms, and 
for retail shops featuring sports team related clothing and apparel likely to cause confusion); In re 
Country Oven, Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 443903, at *12 (TTAB 2019) (holding the use of identical marks for 
bread buns and retail bakery stores and shops likely to cause confusion); In re House Beer, LLC, 114 
USPQ2d 1073, 1078 (TTAB 2015) (holding the use of identical marks for beer and for retail store 
services featuring beer likely to cause confusion); TMEP §1207.01(a)(ii).
 
In this case, the applied-for retail services are for "natural goods including health and beauty products." 
The registrant's goods include "nutritional, dietary and food supplements" and "vitamin supplements." 
The attached internet evidence from Bed, Bath & Beyond, Sam's Club, and K Mark establishes that 
these goods are health and beauty products. The relatedness is also demonstrated by applicant's 
specimen, which shows that the mark is used in connection with "health & beauty gummies," which are 
essentially "vitamin supplements."
 
Accordingly, the goods and services are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of confusion 
analysis.
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods and/or services are related/legally identical, there is a 
likelihood of confusion as to the source of applicant’s services.  Therefore, applicant’s mark is not 
entitled to registration. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
SPECIMEN ISSUE
 
Specimen does not show use of the mark in commerce. Registration is refused because the specimen 
does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in International Class 35. Trademark 
Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of services 
identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Specifically, the provided specimen consist of a digital version of a label for vitamins and a photo of 
the label on a jar of vitamins. These specimens are insufficient because they do not demonstrate that 
applicant is offering "retail services." The specimens demonstrate that applicant is offering "health and 
beauty products" featuring the mark, but not services. That is, the material do not show the mark in the 
sale or rendering of the applied-for services. 
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of theservices.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).  Any webpage printout or 
screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or 
printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified 
statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); 
TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in 
commerce for the services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following 
statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. 
§2.20: “The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) 
was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or 
prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be 
accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES AMENDMENT
 
Applicant’s identification of goods and services includes wording that is indefinite, overly broad, 
and/or includes goods or services in multiple classes as explained below.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.
 
Note, in the identification of goods and services, applicant must use the common commercial or generic 
names for the goods or services, be as complete and specific as possible, and avoid the use of indefinite 
words and phrases.  TMEP §1402.03(a); see 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6).
 
The wording “On-line retail store services featuring natural goods including health and beauty products 
and e-books” in the identification of services is indefinite and must be deleted and replaced with a 
definite term, such as “namely,” “consisting of,” “particularly,” or “in particular.” See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03(a). The identification must be specific and all-inclusive. This 
wording is an open-ended term (e.g., “including” and “such as”) that is not acceptable because it fails to 
identify specific services. See TMEP §1402.03(a).  
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: "On-line retail store services featuring 
natural goods, namely, health and beauty products, and e-books."Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand the 
goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06.  Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be reinserted.  
See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04. 
 
DESCRIPTION OF MARK AMENDMENT REQUIRED
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one uses broad, vague 
language that does not accurately describe the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. 
Descriptions must be accurate and identify all the literal and design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.37; TMEP §808.02. In this case, the description is vague because it does not describe all literal 
elements and colors in the mark.
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate: The mark consists of the wording "STARSEED 
COMMODITIES, INC." where "STARSEED" appears in large bold red font wrapped around 
the top of a design and "COMMODITIES, INC." appears in small red stylized font wrapped 
around the bottom. The design consists of a circular tree of life design in yellow and white 
containing a stick figure person in orange sitting in a meditative crossed legs position with seven 
filled circles representing the seven chakras in the colors light purple, purple, blue, green, yellow, 
orange, and red from top to bottom vertically within the stick figure.
 
Color Claim: The colors red, yellow, white, orange, purple, blue, green are claims as a feature of 
the mark.  
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “COMMODITIES, INC.” because it is merely descriptive of an 
ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or 
services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from Merriam-Webster shows the word "COMMODITIES" refers to economic 
goods in general. This wording is merely generic for economic goods includes those offered as part of 
the applicant's retail store services. Accordingly, this wording is generic and must be disclaimed.  
 
Applicant must disclaim the abbreviation “INC.” because it merely designates the legal character or 
family business structure of an entity and does not indicate the source of applicant’s goods and/or 
services. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1053, 1127; In re Piano Factory Grp., Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1522, 1526 
(TTAB 2006); In re Patent & Trademark Servs., Inc., 49 USPQ2d 1537, 1539-40 (TTAB 1998); TMEP 
§1213.03(d).
 
Business type designations and abbreviations such as “Corporation,” “Inc.,” “Company,” “LLC,” and 
“Ltd.” or family business designations such as “& Sons” or “Bros.” must be disclaimed, because they 
merely indicate applicant’s business type or structure and generally have no source-indicating capacity. 
TMEP §1213.03(d); see, e.g., Goodyear’s India Rubber Glove Mfg. Co. v. Goodyear Rubber Co., 128U.S. 598, 602-03 (1888); In re Piano Factory Grp., Inc., 85 USPQ2d at 1526; In re Patent & 
Trademark Servs., Inc., 49 USPQ2d at 1539-40.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “COMMODITIES, INC.” apart from the 
mark as shown.
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
 
A.K.A. ADVISORY 
 
Applicant's name is setforth as Starseed Commodities, Inc. but includes an A.K.A. section featuring a 
URL. An applicant’s name should be set out in the correct legal form. TMEP §803.02. Here, a full 
URL including "https://" is unlikely to be a name that applicant is known by. Applicant should amend 
the ownership information section accordingly.

Jeffrey M. FurrUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 26, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119361
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
