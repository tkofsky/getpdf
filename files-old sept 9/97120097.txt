NONFINAL OFFICE ACTIONThe USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
 
Registration Refused - Section 2(d) Likelihood of Confusion
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 1999335. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration ("Exhibit A").
 
The applied-for mark is "VERSELINE" in standard characters for "Cups; Dishes; Pots; Cake molds; 
Containers for household use; Cooking utensils, namely, grills; Scoops for household purposes; 
Soup bowls" in International Class 21.
 
The registered mark is "VERSE'" in typed characters for "Furniture" in International Class 20. 
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant: similarity of the marks, similarity and nature of 
the goods and services, and similarity of the trade channels of the goods and services.  See In re Viterra 
Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
Comparison of Marks
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these 
elements may be sufficient to find the marks confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 
USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d 
per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 (Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
In this instance, the applied-for mark "VERSELINE" and the registered mark "VERSE'" begin with the 
term "VERSE". Marks may be confusingly similar in sound and appearance where the same or similar 
terms appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See In re 
Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and CONFIRMCELLS 
confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii). Here, the shared term "VERSE" is identical in sound, 
appearance, and commercial impression as used in the marks.
 
The inclusion of the term "LINE" in the applied-for mark and the apostrophe in the registered mark 
does not obviate the likelihood of confusion. Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the 
first word in any trademark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 
1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between 
VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”).  The first 
term in each mark is the shared term "VERSE". Further, the apostrophe does not change the 
commercial impression or pronunciation of the shared term.
 
Based on the foregoing, the applied-for mark and registered mark are sufficiently similar to find a 
likelihood of confusion.
 
Comparison of Goods
The compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods] 
emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Here, the goods at issue are related because the goods commonly emanate from the same commercial 
entity. In support thereof, the examining attorney has attached Internet evidence from manufacturers 
and retailers of furniture ("Exhibit B"). This evidence establishes that the same entity, such as 
Room&Board and Pottery Barn, commonly manufactures furniture as well as home goods and 
dinnerware, including cups, dishes, and household containers, under the same mark, which are 
marketed and sold through the same trade channels and to the same classes of consumers.  
 
Thus, the goods of the applicant and registrant are considered related for likelihood of confusion 
purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009).
 
Conclusion
Because the applied-for mark and the registered mark are similar and the goods are related, registration 
is refused for a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.

on August 23, 2022 for

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status &

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
