Prior Pending Application Filed - Application Not Entitled to Register 
 
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 97021389 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
Trademark Act Section 1 and 45 Refusal - Specimen does not show use in commerce as to Class 9
 
Specimen does not show use of the mark in commerce. Registration is refused because the specimen 
does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in International Class(es) 9. 
Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP 
§§904, 904.07(a). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods 
identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Specifically, the specimen of use appears to be a Facebook page connected to applicant. However it 
does not make an explicit connection to any of the goods identified by applicant nor provide the means 
of which to purchase the goods. Rather, the only reference to a good is a photo at the top which shows apicture of what appears to be a printed book. However it is unclear if this is an advertisement or a book 
presumptively provided by applicant. Even if it was a book, which appears to be in print, published by 
applicant, this would not show the goods identified in class 9 as there is no indication that it is an e-
book or in anyway downloadable. As such, the specimen of use does not show use in commerce.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c).  Any webpage 
printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was 
accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a 
verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in 
commerce for the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following 
statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. 
§2.20: “The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) 
was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or 
prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be 
accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. Applicant should note the following 
additional ground for refusal.
 
Trademark Act Section 1 and 45 Refusal - Specimen does not show use in commerce as to class 35
 
Specimen does not show use in specific class(es).  Registration is refused because the specimen does 
not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in connection with any of the goods and/or 
services specified in International Class(es) 35.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79(TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An application based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for 
each international class of goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege 
use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re 
Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013). 
 
Specifically, the specimen of use appears to be missing a significant portion of what appears to be 
applicant's website. The only iteration of the applied for mark appears at the top of the page in the same 
line of the date and time of access and appears to have been added after the fact. As such, the specimen 
of use does not show use in commerce.  
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include:  
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual use 
in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of an 
amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the goods 
and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to

webpage.Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. Applicant should note the following 
additional ground for refusal.
 
Trademark Act Section 1 and 45 Refusal - Specimen of use does not show use in commerce as to 
Class 38
 
Specimen does not show use of the mark in commerce. Registration is refused because the specimen 
does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in International Class(es) 38. 
Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP 
§§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a 
specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of 
services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Specifically, the specimen of use appears to be a screen shot of applicant's Instagram account. The 
specimen use does not make a connection between the applied for mark and the provision of streaming 
services. Rather it merely indicates that applicant is a publisher, who publishes best-selling books and 
audiobooks. It does not indicate that applicant is providing streaming services of any type. As such, the 
specimen of use does not show use in commerce. 
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).  Any webpage printout or 
screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or 
printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified 
statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); 
TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in 
commerce for the services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following 
statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. 
§2.20: “The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) 
was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or 
prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be 
accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. Applicant should note the following 
additional ground for refusal.
 
Trademark Act Section 1 and 45 Refusal - Specimen does not show use in commerce as to Class 
42
 
Specimen does not show use in specific class(es).  Registration is refused because the specimen does 
not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in connection with any of the goods and/or 
services specified in International Class(es) 42.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79 
(TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An application based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for 
each international class of goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege 
use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re 
Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013). 
 
Specifically, the specimen of use appears to be missing a significant portion of what appears to be 
applicant's website. The only iteration of the applied for mark appears at the top of the page in the same 
line of the date and time of access and is merely the product of the printing of the webpage. This does 
not create a connection between the applied for mark and the identified goods as consumers to not 
come across the printed iteration of a website when accessing it and therefore would not see such 
wording when accessing the webpage. As such, the specimen of use does not show use in commerce. 
 
Additionally, the specimen of use does not appear to make a connection to the identified platform 
services. Specifically, the specimen makes no reference or connection to the provision of a platform.  
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include:  
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual use 
in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of an 
amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the goods 
and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.”  The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing 
an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before 
publication.  This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, 
including a specimen.

options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. Applicant should note the following 
additional ground for refusal.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(e)(4) Refusal- Primarily Merely A Surname 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is primarily merely a surname. Trademark Act 
Section 2(e)(4), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(4); see TMEP §1211.
 
An applicant’s mark is primarily merely a surname if the surname, when viewed in connection with the 
applicant’s recited goods and/or services, “‘is the primary significance of the mark as a whole to the 
purchasing public.’” Earnhardt v. Kerry Earnhardt, Inc., 864 F.3d 1374, 1377, 123 USPQ2d 1411, 
1413 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting In re Hutchinson Tech. Inc., 852 F.2d 552, 554, 7 USPQ2d 1490, 1492 
(Fed. Cir. 1988)); TMEP §1211.01.
 
The following five inquiries are often used to determine the public’s perception of a term’s primary 
significance:
 
(1)        Whether the surname is rare;
 
(2)        Whether anyone connected with applicant uses the term as a surname;
 
(3)        Whether the term has any recognized meaning other than as a surname;
 
(4)        Whether the term has the structure and pronunciation of a surname; and
 
(5)        Whether the term is sufficiently stylized to remove its primarysignificance from that of a surname.
 
In re Colors in Optics, Ltd., 2020 USPQ2d 53784, at *1-2 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Benthin Mgmt. 
GmbH, 37 USPQ2d 1332, 1333-34 (TTAB 1995) for the Benthin inquiries/factors); TMEP §1211.01; 
see also In re Etablissements Darty et Fils, 759 F.2d 15, 16-18, 225 USPQ 652, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
 
These inquiries or factors are not exclusive, and any of these circumstances – singly or in combination 
– and any other relevant circumstances may be considered when making this determination. In re tapio 
GmbH, 2020 USPQ2d 11387, at *9 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Eximius Coffee, LLC, 120 USPQ2d 
1276, 1277-78 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1211.01. For example, when the applied-for mark is not 
stylized, it is unnecessary to consider the fifth inquiry. In re Yeley, 85 USPQ2d 1150, 1151 (TTAB 
2007); TMEP §1211.01.
 
The Surname BLACKSTONE is not Rare 
 
See the attached evidence from m www.advance.lexis.com, establishing the surname significance of 
BLACKSTONE. This evidence shows the applied-for mark appearing 10,374 times as a surname in the 
LEXISNEXIS® surname database, which is a weekly updated directory of cell phone and other phone

Neutral Factor- Whether Anyone Connected with Applicant Uses the Term as a Surname 
 
It is unclear whether anyone associated with the applicant uses the term BLACKSTONE as a surname. 
In a surname analysis, the absence of a person connected with applicant that has this term as a surname 
is a neutral factor. In re Thermo LabSystems Inc., 85 USPQ2d at 1287. In re Thermo LabSystems Inc., 
85 USPQ2d 1285, 1287 (TTAB 2007) (quoting In re Gregory, 70 USPQ2d 1792, 1795 (TTAB 2004)); 
see In re Adlon Brand GmbH & Co. KG, 120 USPQ2d 1717, 1724 (TTAB 2016). 
 
The term Blackstone has a recognized meaning as a surname and minimal significance other than a 
surname 
 
Evidence that a word has no meaning or significance other than as a surname is relevant to determining 
whether the word would be perceived as primarily merely a surname. See In re Petrin Corp., 231 
USPQ 902, 903 (TTAB 1986); TMEP §1211.02(b)(vi).
 
The evidence attached from https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Blackstone indicates that Blackstone is 
understood to be a surname. 
 
Similarly, the attached screenshot from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone,_Massachusetts 
shows that BLACKSTONE is the name of a small town in Massachusetts with a population of 
approximately 9,000 but has no other geographic significance. The fact that a term is shown to have 
some minor significance as a geographical term will not dissipate its primary significance as a surname. 
See In re Hamilton Pharm. Ltd., 27 USPQ2d 1939, 1943 (TTAB 1993); In re Picone, 221 USPQ 93, 95 
(TTAB 1984); TMEP §1211.01(a)(iii). 
 
 
Combining a surname with a term that is merely descriptive, primarily geographically descriptive or 
deceptively misdescriptive, or generic of an applicant’s goods and/or services typically does not 
“detract from the primary surname significance” of the mark. Azeka Bldg. Corp. v. Azeka, 122 USPQ2d1477, 1481-82, 1481 n.9 (TTAB 2017) (construing In re Hutchinson Tech. Inc., 852 F.2d 552, 554, 7 
USPQ2d 1490, 1492-93 (Fed. Cir. 1988)); see TMEP §1211.01(b)(vi).
 
Specifically, applicant identifies publishing services. As such, the wording is merely descriptive. 
 
Blackstone has the Structure and Pronunciation of a Surname 
 
Blackstone has the structure and pronunciation of a surname. Specifically, it is similar to the structure 
and/or pronunciation of other common surnames, such as BLACKWELL and Stone. Please see the 
evidence attached from www.advance.lexis.com. 
 
The applied-for Mark is in Standard Character Form 
 
Applicant has applied-for the mark Blackstone in standard character form. As such, the mark is lacking 
any stylization which could remove its primary significance from that of a surname. 
 
For the reasons stated above, registration is refused under Trademark Act Section 2(e)(4) because the 
applied-for mark is primarily merely a surname. 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(4). 
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register. Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816. Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant 
from submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal(s). TMEP §816.04.
 
Disclaimer Required 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “PUBLISHING” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
Applicant identifies publishing services. Thus, the wording merely describes applicant’s goods and/or 
services.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “PUBLISHING” apart from the mark as 
shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
Amendment to Identification of Goods and/or Services Required
 
Applicant must clarify the following indicated language for reasons stated below. See 37 C.F.R.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118784
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
