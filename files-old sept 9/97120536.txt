NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic ApplicationSystem (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Specimen Refusal 
•
Improper Use of Registration Notice 
•
Identification of Services 
•
Multiple-Class Application Requirements 
•
Disclaimer Required
•
 
SPECIMEN REFUSAL 
 
Specimen does not show direct association between mark and services.  Registration is refused 
because the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and the services and fails to 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the identified services in International 
Class 41.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 
2.56(a), (b)(2); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(f)(ii), (g)(i).  An application based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for 
each international class of services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  15 U.S.C. 
§1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a). 
 
When determining whether a mark is used in connection with the services in the application, a key 
consideration is the perception of the user.  In re JobDiva, Inc., 843 F.3d 936, 942, 121 USPQ2d 1122, 
1126 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., 686 F.3d 1376, 1381-82, 103 
USPQ2d 1672, 1676 (Fed Cir. 2012)).  A specimen must show the mark used in a way that would 
create in the minds of potential consumers a sufficient nexus or direct association between the mark and 
the services being offered.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2); In re Universal Oil Prods. Co., 476 F.2d 653, 
655, 177 USPQ2d 456, 457 (C.C.P.A. 1973); TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii). 
 
To show a direct association, specimens consisting of advertising or promotional materials must (1) 
explicitly reference the services and (2) show the mark used to identify the services and their source.  In 
re The Cardio Grp., LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 227232, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re WAY Media, LLC, 
118 USPQ2d 1697, 1698 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii).  Although the exact nature of the 
services does not need to be specified in the specimen, there must be something that creates in the mind 
of the purchaser an association between the mark and the services.  In re Adair, 45 USPQ2d 1211, 1215 
(TTAB 1997) (quoting In re Johnson Controls Inc., 33 USPQ2d 1318, 1320 (TTAB 1994)).In the present case, the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and services in 
that while the specimen does bear applicant’s mark, it does not mention or reference applicant’s Class 
41 services in any way. While it is not necessary that the services be stated word for word, the 
specimen must contain a “sufficient reference” to the services themselves or a general reference to the 
trade, industry, or field of use. TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii). Thus, based on the specimen, the consumer 
would not make an association between applicant’s claimed services and the mark AGILE DIGITAL 
EXPERIENCE MANAGEMENT (ADEM).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include:  (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).  Any webpage printout or 
screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or 
printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified 
statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); 
TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the 
filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for 
the services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified substitute 
specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in a signed 
affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or new, or 
originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as 
early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to allege 
use.”  The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication.  This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
IMPROPER USE OF REGISTRATION NOTICE 
 
The specimen shows use of the federal registration symbol ® with the applied-for mark. However, the 
USPTO records do not show that the mark is registered. Applicant may not use the federal registration 
symbol until its mark is registered in the USPTO. TMEP §§906, 906.03. After registration, applicant 
may use this symbol in connection with the specific goods and/or services listed in the registration. Id.
 
This information is advisory only. Applicant need not respond to this issue.IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES 
 
Applicant must clarify the identification of services in International Class 41 because it is indefinite and 
too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because 
the nature of the services are unclear. Further, this wording could identify services in more than one 
international class. For example, downloadable electronic publication sin the nature of books in the 
field of improving communication in digital organizations are in International Class 9, printed 
publications, namely, books in the field business communications are in International Class 16, 
consulting services in the field of business management for digital organization are in International 
Class 35 and training services in the field of digital business organization are in International Class 41.
 
In addition, applicant must remove its mark, "Agile Digital Experience Management (ADEM)" from 
the identification. An applicant should not use its own registered or unregistered mark in an 
identification of goods and/or services. TMEP §1402.09. Identifications of services should generally be 
comprised of generic everyday wording for the services, and exclude proprietary or potentially-
proprietary wording, such as a registered term. See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.09. The misspelling or 
phonetic equivalent of a registered mark should similarly be excluded, unless it is the common name of 
the goods and/or services. TMEP §1402.09.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 9: Downloadable electronic publications in the nature of  ______{indicate specific 
nature of publication, e.g., books, magazines, manuals, etc.} in the field of managing 
customer experiences with digital organizations 
 
Class 16: Printed publications, namely, ____ {indicate form of publications, e.g., books, hand-
outs, workbooks, etc.} in the field of managing customer experiences with digital organizations
 
Class 35: consulting services in the field of managing customer experiences for digital 
organizations
 
Class 41: training services in the field of managing customer experiences with digital 
organizations; providing educational examination for certification in the field of ___ {indicate 
specific field or subject matter, e.g., business, digital customer service, customer experience 
management, etc.} 
 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
 See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06.  Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later 
be reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTIPLE CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
 
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than oneinternational class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the 
fee already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 4 
classes; however, applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only 1 class. Applicant must 
either (a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) 
restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
not acceptable for any international class. See more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or 
advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce 
on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as 
early as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(a) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIREDApplicant must disclaim the wording “DIGITAL EXPERIENCE MANAGEMENT” because it is 
merely descriptive of an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of 
applicant’s services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, 
Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
 The attached evidence from Merriam-Webster shows that the wording DIGITAL means something 
related to electronics or computerized technology, EXPERIENCE means something personally 
encountered and MANAGEMENT means the supervising of something. See attached definitions.  The 
attached evidence from The Tilt, The Future of Customer Engagement and Experience, and 
Zensar shows that third-parties uses the wording DIGITAL EXPERIENCE MANAGEMENT to 
describe a type of business service that is concerned with a customer's interaction with a business in the 
digital environment. See attached website screen captures. Thus, the wording merely describes 
applicant’s goods and/or services because they feature information relating to the supervision of 
customers personal experiences with a business via computerized technology.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “DIGITAL EXPERIENCE 
MANAGEMENT” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center.

have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
