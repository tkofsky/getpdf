SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive
•
Advisory: Supplemental Register Option
•
Identification of Goods and Services 
•
Information About Goods and Services Required 
•
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature or characteristic of 
applicant’s goods and services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP 
§§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s goods 
and/or services, not in the abstract. DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 
675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b). “Whether 
consumers could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the 
test.” In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).
 
Here, applicant has applied for the mark MEMORIES METAVERSE in standard characters for use in 
connection with "downloadable software for photo, video, text, voice, GPS data storage, sharing and 
organization; downloadable artificial intelligence and machine learning software for photo, video, text, 
voice, and GPS data storage, sharing and organization; downloadable virtual reality software for 
creating interactive entertainment experiences in a simulated environment" in Class 9, "providing 
temporary use of online non-downloadable game software featuring virtual reality, augmented reality, 
mixed reality, and enhanced sensory information experiences; entertainment and educational services, 
namely, providing experiences in the nature of virtual reality, augmented reality, and mix reality gameservices provided on-line from a computer network; virtual reality game services provided on-line from 
a computer network; providing online augmented reality games; providing enhanced sensory 
entertainment information in the nature of information about virtual reality, augmented reality, and 
mixed reality services; entertainment and educational services, namely, providing a web site featuring 
photographs, video, and voice prose presentations featuring actors, musicians, and users in the field of 
art, music, theater, news, current events, and social media; entertainment and educational services, 
namely, providing a website featuring non-downloadable photographs; entertainment and educational 
services, namely, providing a website featuring non-downloadable videos featuring actors, musicians, 
and users in the field of art, music, theater, news, current events, and social media; entertainment and 
educational services, namely, providing online non-downloadable e-textbooks in the field of fiction and 
non-fiction; entertainment and educational services, namely, live audio voice performances by actors, 
musicians, and users in the field of art, music, theater, news, current events, and social media; 
entertainment and educational services, namely, providing a website featuring non-downloadable audio 
and video recordings featuring actors, musicians, and users in the field of art, music, theater, news, 
current events, and social media" in Class 41, and "Providing temporary use of online non-
downloadable software for virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and enhanced sensory 
information experiences for non-gaming entertainment, education, and training; providing temporary 
use of online non-downloadable software for photo, video, text, voice, and GPS data storage, sharing 
and organization; providing temporary use of online non-downloadable artificial intelligence and 
machine learning software for photo, video, text, voice, GPS data storage, sharing and organization; 
providing temporary use of online non-downloadable virtual reality software for creating interactive 
entertainment experiences in a simulated environment" in Class 42.
 
The attached evidence from Lexico dictionary shows that the word "memory" means "something 
remembered from the past; a recollection" and the word "metaverse" means "a virtual-reality space in 
which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users."  Moreover, the 
attached evidence from Cointelegraph, Remember, ScanMyPhotos Digital, and User Walls shows that 
the words "memories" and "metaverse" are often used in connection with similar software goods and/or 
services to mean that the software allows users to save, store, and/or share memories in the metaverse.  
Thus, the wording merely describes a feature or characteristic of applicant's goods and services because 
applicant's software will allow users to save, store and/or share memories in the metaverse.
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods and/or services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not 
registrable. In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re 
Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as 
hypodermic, aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 
(TTAB 2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner 
that is an integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services is the combined mark 
registrable. See In re Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial 
Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 
364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result, as described above, aredescriptive of applicant’s goods and services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive 
meaning in relation to the goods and services. Specifically, the term MEMORIES conveys that 
applicant's software will allow users to save, store, and/or share something remembered from the past, 
the term METAVERSE conveys that applicant's software will allow users to interact in a virtual-reality 
space, and the combination of the terms MEMORIES METAVERSE conveys that applicant's software 
will allow users to save, store, and/or share something remembered from the past in a virtual-reality 
space.
 
Ultimately, when purchasers encounter applicant’s goods and services using the mark MEMORIES 
METAVERSE, they will immediately understand the mark as an indication of a feature or 
characteristic of applicant’s goods and services and not an indication that applicant is the source of the 
goods and services.  Therefore, the mark is merely descriptive and registration is refused pursuant to 
Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act. 
 
ADVISORY: SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTER OPTION
 
Although an amendment to the Supplemental Register would be an appropriate response to this 
refusal in an application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) or 44, such a response is not appropriate 
in the present case. The instant application was filed under Section 1(b) and is not eligible for 
registration on the Supplemental Register until an acceptable amendment to allege use meeting the 
requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been timely filed. 37 C.F.R. §2.47(d); TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03.
 
If applicant files an acceptable allegation of use and also amends to the Supplemental Register, the 
application effective filing date will be the date applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 
37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for an amendment to allege use. TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b). 
In addition, the undersigned trademark examining attorney will conduct a new search of the USPTO 
records for conflicting marks based on the later application filing date. TMEP §§206.01, 1102.03.
 
Applicant is advised that, if the application is amended to seek registration on the Supplemental 
Register, applicant will be required to disclaim “METAVERSE” because such wording appears to be 
generic in the context of applicant’s goods and services. See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Wella Corp., 
565 F.2d 143, 144, 196 USPQ 7, 8 (C.C.P.A. 1977); In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 
USPQ 766, 768 (TTAB 1986); TMEP §1213.03(b).
 
Applicant may submit a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “METAVERSE” apart from the mark as 
shown.
 
TMEP §1213.08(a)(i).
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICESSome of the wording in the identification of goods and services is indefinite and must be clarified 
because it does not specify the type of goods and services provided. For example, the wording 
“entertainment and educational services, namely, providing a web site featuring photographs, video, 
and voice prose presentations featuring actors, musicians, and users in the field of art, music, theater, 
news, current events, and social media” and "entertainment and educational services, namely, providing 
online non-downloadable e-textbooks in the field of fiction and non-fiction" in the identification of 
services is indefinite because it does not specify the nature of the services provided, such as providing a 
web site featuring non-downloadable photographs, videos, and voice presentations, or the field of the e-
textbooks, such as e-textbooks in the field of virtual reality. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§1402.01.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:

and mixed reality game services provided on-line from a computer network; virtual reality game 
services provided on-line from a computer network; providing online augmented reality games; 
providing enhanced sensory entertainment information in the nature of information about virtual 
reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality services; entertainment and educational services, namely, 
providing a web site featuring non-downloadable photographs, video, and voice prose presentations 
featuring actors, musicians, and users in the field of art, music, theater, news, current events, and social 
media; entertainment and educational services, namely, providing a website featuring non-
downloadable photographs; entertainment and educational services, namely, providing a website 
featuring non-downloadable videos featuring actors, musicians, and users in the field of art, music, 
theater, news, current events, and social media; entertainment and educational services, namely, 
providing online non-downloadable e-textbooks in the field of virtual reality, augmented reality, and 
mixed reality; entertainment and educational services, namely, live audio voice performances by 
actors, musicians, and users in the field of art, music, theater, news, current events, and social media; 
entertainment and educational services, namely, providing a website featuring non-downloadable audio 
and video recordings featuring actors, musicians, and users in the field of art, music, theater, news, 
current events, and social media 
 
Class 42: Providing temporary use of online non-downloadable software for virtual reality, augmented 
reality, mixed reality, and enhanced sensory information experiences for non-gaming entertainment, 
education, and training; providing temporary use of online non-downloadable software for photo, 
video, text, voice, and GPS data storage, sharing and organization; providing temporary use of online 
non-downloadable artificial intelligence and machine learning software for photo, video, text, voice, 
and GPS data storage, sharing and organization; providing temporary use of online non-downloadable 
virtual reality software for creating interactive entertainment experiences in a simulated environment 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended.See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
INFORMATION ABOUT GOODS AND SERVICES REQUIRED 
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must submit additional information about 
applicant’s goods and services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §814. The required information should 
include fact sheets, instruction manuals, brochures, and/or advertisements. If these materials are 
unavailable, applicant should submit similar documentation for goods and services of the same type, 
explaining how its own product or services will differ. If the goods and services feature new technology 
and no information regarding competing goods and services is available, applicant must provide a 
detailed factual description of the goods and services.
 
Factual information about the goods must clearly indicate how they operate, their salient features, and 
their prospective customers and channels of trade. Factual information about the services must clearly 
indicate what the services are and how they are rendered, their salient features, and their prospective 
customers and channels of trade. Conclusory statements will not satisfy this requirement for 
information.
 
In addition, applicant must answer the following questions regarding the goods and services:
 
Will applicant's software allow users to save, store, and/or share memories, personal 
photographs, personal videos, and/or personal stories?
1. 
Will applicant's software allow users to interact with a computer-generated environment and/or 
other users in the metaverse?
2. 
What is the significance of the term "MEMORIES" in the mark?
3. 
 
If applicant submits webpage evidence to satisfy this requirement, applicant must provide (1) an image 
of the webpage, (2) the date it was accessed or printed, and (3) the complete URL address. In re ADCO 
Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 
1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018)); TMEP §710.01(b). Providing only a website address or hyperlink to the 
webpage is not sufficient to make the materials of record. In re ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 
USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (citing In re Olin Corp., 124 USPQ2d 1327, 1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB 
Solomon Assocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); TBMP §1208.03); TMEP §814.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
