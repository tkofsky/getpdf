NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 27, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
    A.    Section 2(d) Refusal -- Likelihood of Confusion  
    B.    Prior-Filed Application May Bar Registration  
 
A.    SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL -- LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 4409970 and 6711910. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); seeTMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registrations.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark OMERRA in standard characters for "Abrasive pads for 
kitchen purposes; Appliances for removing make-up, non-electric; Barbecue tongs; Barbecue turners; 
Bottle openers, electric and non-electric; Button hooks; Cleaning brushes for barbecue grills; Coffee 
stirrers; Containers for household or kitchen use; Drinking flasks; Egg rings; Grill scrapers; Household 
gloves for general use; Household utensils, namely, spatulas; Squeeze bottles sold empty" in 
International Class 21.
 
The cited registered marks are as follows:
 
Registration No. 4409970 -- OMIERA in standard characters for "Anti-aging cream; Cosmetic 
preparations for skin renewal; Hair care creams; Nail care preparations; Non-medicated facial 
and eye serum containing antioxidants; Non-medicated hair treatment preparations for cosmetic 
purposes" in International Class 3.  
 
•
Registration No. 6711910 -- OMAIRA in stylized text with a design for "Bath accessories, 
namely, cup holders; Containers for household or kitchen use; General purpose storage bins for 
household use; Plastic bath racks; Portable plastic containers for storing household and kitchen 
goods; Rails and rings for towels; Shower caddies; Shower racks; Soap dispensers; Soap holders; 
Squeegees for household use" in International Class 21.
•
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marksconfusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Considering the marks in their entireties, applicant's mark OMERRA is similar in appearance to the 
cited marks OMIERA and OMAIRA in that the marks comprise similar wording. Each mark consists of 
six letters, with the first two letters being "OM-", and the last two letters being "-RA." 
 
Moreover, the marks can also be pronounced the same, and are thus similar in sound. Similarity in 
sound alone may be sufficient to support a finding that the compared marks are confusingly similar. In 
re 1st USA Realty Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007) (citing Krim-Ko Corp. v. Coca-
Cola Bottling Co., 390 F.2d 728, 732, 156 USPQ 523, 526 (C.C.P.A. 1968)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iv).
 
Further, because the marks appear to be meaningless, each mark is likely to convey a similar 
commercial impression as a coined term.
 
Although the cited mark OMAIRA includes a design, the relatively simple rectangular design does not 
detract significantly from the similarities between applicant's and registrant's mark. When evaluating a 
composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is normally accorded greater weight 
because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be remembered by them, and be used 
by them to refer to or request the goods and/or services. In re Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 
1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 
(Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks must be compared in their entireties, 
the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is accorded greater weight in determining 
whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra 
Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 
710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).
 
Because the marks comprise similar, phonetically equivalent wording and are likely to convey the same 
overall commercial impression, the marks are considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes. 
 
Relatedness of the Goods
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
When analyzing an applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services for similarity and relatedness, that 
determination is based on the description of the goods and/or services in the application and registrationat issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use. See Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital 
LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1323, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Octocom Sys. Inc. v. 
Hous. Computers Servs. Inc., 918 F.2d 937, 942, 16 USPQ2d 1783, 1787 (Fed. Cir. 1990)).
 
Registration No. 4409970 (OMIERA) 
 
In this case, applicant's "Appliances for removing make-up, non-electric" are considered related to 
registrant's cosmetics goods because the same entity frequently provides goods similar to applicant's 
and registrant's under the same mark. This makes confusion likely where, as here, similar marks for the 
goods are used in connection with different entities. 
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of website excerpts featuring products from Maybelline, 
Olay, and Sephora, establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides 
"Appliances for removing make-up, non-electric" (applicant's goods) and (2) "Anti-aging cream" 
and/or "Cosmetic preparations for skin renewal" (registrant's goods), and markets the goods under the 
same mark.  Thus, these goods in the aplication are considered related to registrant's goods for 
likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 
(TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Registration No. 6711910 (OMAIRA) 
 
In this case, applicant's and registrant's goods are related in that the application and registration both list 
common home and kitchen goods in International Class 21. Applicant's and registrant's goods are thus 
similar in nature.
 
Indeed, the goods in the application and registration are identical as to "Containers for household or 
kitchen use." Therefore, it is presumed that the channels of trade and class(es) of purchasers are the 
same for these goods. See Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1372, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 
(Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are related.
 
Applicant's other Class 21 kitchen goods are also related to registrant's kitchen goods. The attached 
Internet evidence, consisting of website excerpts from Crate & Barrel, Ikea, and Pottery Barn, 
establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides (1) Class 21 kitchen 
goods similar to those in the application and (2) "Containers for household or kitchen use" and/or 
"General purpose storage bins for household use," and markets the goods under the same mark.  Thus, 
applicant’s and registrant’s goods are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, 
e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. 
Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Conclusion 
 
Because applicant's and registrants' marks are similar and the goods associated with the marks are 
related, there is a likelihood of confusion as to the source of applicant's goods. Therefore, applicant's 
mark is not entitled to registration. 
 
Applicant should note the following potential additional ground for refusal.
 
B.    PRIOR-FILED APPLICATION MAY BAR REGISTRATIONThe filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 79318917 (OMERAS) precedes applicant’s 
filing date.  See attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, 
applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood 
of confusion between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  
Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be 
suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
RESPONDING TO THIS OFFICE ACTION

rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
