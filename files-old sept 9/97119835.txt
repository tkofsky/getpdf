 Search Results
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
1.    Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2) - Refusal to Register Geographically Descriptive Mark
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is primarily geographically descriptive of the 
origin of applicant’s goods and services. Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); see 
TMEP §§1210, 1210.01(a).
 
The refusal under Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2) is now made FINAL for the reasons set forth below. 
See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); 37 C.F.R. §2.63(b).
 
A mark is primarily geographically descriptive when the following is demonstrated:
 
(1)        The primary significance of the mark to the purchasing public is a generally 
known location;
 
(2)        The goods or services originate in the place identified in the mark; and
 
(3)        The purchasing public would be likely to believe that the goods or servicesoriginate in the geographic place identified in the mark; that is, to make a goods-place or 
services-place association.
 
See Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *5 (TTAB 2020) (citing 
In re Nantucket, Inc., 677 F.2d 95, 96-97, 213 USPQ 889, 891 (C.C.P.A. 1982)); see also In re 
Newbridge Cutlery Co., 776 F.3d 854, 860-61, 113 USPQ2d 1445, 1448-49 (Fed. Cir. 2015); In re 
Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1452 (Fed. 
Cir. 1987); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 (TTAB 2001)); TMEP §1210.01(a).  
 
The mark in the application is "ALBERT, TEXAS for "Stickers; Dishware; Hats; Tee shirts; Musical 
floor shows provided at performance venues; Restaurant; Bar services; Providing facilities for wedding 
ceremonies." 
 
Primary 
significance. The 
attached 
evidence from 
https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/albert-tx 
and 
http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasHillCountryTowns/Albert-Texas.htm shows that "ALBERT" is 
a town in Texas. "TEXAS" is a state in the southern United States. See attached definition from the 
online American Heritage Dictionary. Together, the primary significance of "ALBERT, TEXAS" is to 
identify a geographic location in Texas.  
 
Goods/services originate in named place. Goods are considered to originate from a geographic 
location when the record shows that the goods are sold there, manufactured or produced there, 
packaged and shipped from there, and/or contain a main ingredient or component derived from there. 
See, e.g., City of London Distillery, Ltd. v. Hayman Grp. Ltd., 2020 USPQ2d 11487, at *9-10 (TTAB 
2020) (holding applicant’s gin originated within or near the city limits of London, because it was 
distilled in London and bottled just outside of London); In re Joint-Stock Co. “Baik,” 80 USPQ2d 
1305, 1310 (TTAB 2006) (holding applicant’s vodka originated from BAIKALSKAYA, a Russian 
word meaning “from Baikal,” because it was made from the water of Lake Baikal and applicant 
produced various vodkas from a location near Lake Baikal); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 
1083 (TTAB 2001) (holding applicant’s cigars, cigar cases, and humidors originated from 
MINNESOTA because they were packaged and shipped from MINNESOTA, and applicant’s business 
was located in MINNESOTA); TMEP §1210.03.
 
For services to originate in a geographic place, the record must show that they are rendered at least in 
part in the geographic place. See In re Chalk’s Int’l Airline Inc., 21 USPQ2d 1637 (TTAB 1991) 
(holding PARADISE ISLAND AIRLINES primarily geographically descriptive of air transportation 
services of passengers and/or goods that are performed at least in part on Paradise Island); In re Cal. 
Pizza Kitchen Inc., 10 USPQ2d 1704 (TTAB 1988) (holding CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN 
primarily geographically descriptive of restaurant services rendered in California and outside the state 
as well); In re Opryland USA Inc., 1 USPQ2d 1409 (TTAB 1986) (holding THE NASHVILLE 
NETWORK primarily geographically descriptive of television production and distribution services 
provided in Nashville); TMEP §1210.03.
 
In this case, the goods and services originate in Albert, Texas. See attached from applicant's website 
at https://www.alberttexas.com/ listing applicant's address as "Albert-Stonewall, TX." "TX" is an 
abbreviation for "Texas". See attached definition from the American Heritage Dictionary online.
 
Goods/services place association presumed. A goods-place or services-place association may be 
presumed where (1) the location in the mark is generally known to the purchasing public, (2) the term’sgeographical significance is its primary significance, and (3) the goods and/or services do, in fact, 
originate from the named location in the mark. TMEP §1210.04; see, e.g., In re Cal. Pizza Kitchen Inc., 
10 USPQ2d 1704, 1705 (TTAB 1988) (finding a services-place association was presumed between 
applicant’s restaurant services and California because the services originated in California); In re 
Handler Fenton Ws., Inc., 214 USPQ 848, 850 (TTAB 1982) (finding a goods-place association was 
presumed between applicant’s t-shirts and Denver because the goods had their geographical origin in 
Denver); see also In re Nantucket, Inc., 677 F.2d 95, 102, 213 USPQ 889, 895 (C.C.P.A. 1982) (Nies, 
J., concurring) (“[W]e must start with the concept that a geographic name of a place of business is a 
descriptive term when used on the goods of that business. There is a public goods/place association, in 
effect, presumed.” (internal footnote removed)).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. 
 
Advisory re Supplemental Register. The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the 
Principal Register. Applicant may respond to the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in 
support of registration and/or by amending the application to seek registration on the Supplemental 
Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816. Amending to the 
Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant from submitting evidence and arguments against the 
refusal(s). TMEP §816.04. 
  
2.        Specimen Shows Ornamental Use for International Classes 16, 21 and 25 - Registration 
Refused 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark as used on the specimen of record is merely a 
decorative or ornamental feature of the goods in International Classes 16, 21 and 25, and, thus, does not 
function as a trademark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and to identify and distinguish them 
from others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1052, 1127; see In re Villeroy & 
Boch S.A.R.L., 5 USPQ2d 1451, 1454 (TTAB 1987); TMEP §§904.07(b), 1202.03 et seq.
 
Whether a designation functions as a mark depends on the commercial impression it makes on the 
relevant public; that is, whether purchasers would likely regard it as a source-indicator for the goods. 
See In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1879 (TTAB 2017) (quoting In re Eagle Crest 
Inc., 96 USPQ2d 1227, 1229 (TTAB 2010)); TMEP §1202. The specimen and any other relevant 
evidence of use is reviewed to determine whether an applied-for mark is being used as a trademark. In 
re Bose Corp., 546 F.2d 893, 897, 192 USPQ 213, 216 (C.C.P.A. 1976); In re Volvo Cars of N. Am., 
Inc., 46 USPQ2d 1455, 1459 (TTAB 1998).
 
The mark as shown on the specimen for International Class 16 would be perceived as merely a 
decorative or ornamental feature of the goods because it covers the majority of the surface of the 
sticker.  The mark shown on the specimen for International Class 21 would be perceived as decorative 
because it is incorporated into the design that covers half the surface of the goods.
 
The size, location, dominance, and significance of the alleged mark as used on the goods are all 
relevant factors in determining the commercial impression of the applied-for mark. See, e.g., In re 
Peace Love World Live, LLC, 127 USPQ2d 1400, 1403 (TTAB 2018) (quoting In re Hulting, 107 
USPQ2d 1175, 1178 (TTAB 2013)); In re Lululemon Athletica Can. Inc., 105 USPQ2d at 1687 
(quoting In re Right-On Co., 87 USPQ2d 1152, 1156 (TTAB 2008)); TMEP §1202.03(a).The specimens for International Class 25 show the applied-for mark as part of the design covering the 
front of the hat, and the top half of the front of the tank top. With respect to clothing, consumers may 
recognize small designs or discrete wording as trademarks, rather than as merely ornamental features, 
when located, for example, on the pocket or breast area of a shirt. See TMEP §1202.03(a). Consumers 
may not, however, perceive larger designs or slogans as trademarks when such matter is prominently 
displayed across the front of a t-shirt. See In re Pro-Line Corp., 28 USPQ2d 1141, 1142 (TTAB 1993); 
TMEP §1202.03(a), (b), (f)(i), (f)(ii). Nor would consumers perceive designs on pants’ pockets as 
trademarks. See In re Right-On Co., 87 USPQ2d at 1156-57.
 
Thus, the applied-for mark appears to be a design element that is used in a merely decorative manner 
that would be perceived by consumers as having little or no particular source-identifying significance.
 
Therefore, consumers would view the applied-for mark as a decorative or ornamental feature of the 
goods, rather than as a trademark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and to distinguish them 
from others.  
 
In appropriate circumstances, applicant may overcome this refusal by satisfying one of the following 
options:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application (or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use) and (b) shows proper trademark use for each 
international class identified in the application or amendment to allege use.
 
(2)        Amend to the Supplemental Register, which is a second trademark register 
for marks not yet eligible for registration on the Principal Register, but which may become 
capable over time of functioning as source indicators.
 
(3)        Claim acquired distinctiveness under Trademark Act Section 2(f) by 
submitting evidence that the applied-for mark has become distinctive of applicant’s goods; 
that is, proof that applicant’s extensive use and promotion of the mark has allowed 
consumers now directly to associate the mark with applicant as the source of the goods.
 
(4)        Submit evidence that the applied-for mark is an indicator of secondary 
source; that is, proof that the mark is already recognized as a source indicator for other 
goods or services that applicant sells/offers.
 
(5)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b). This option will 
later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements.

3.       Mark in Drawing and Mark on Specimen Do Not Match for International Classes 16, 21,25, 41, 43 and 45 - Registration Refused
 
Mark shown on drawing does not match mark on specimen. Registration is refused because the 
specimen does not show the mark in the drawing in use in commerce in International Class(es) 16, 21, 
25, 41, 43 and 45 which is required in the application or amendment to allege use. Trademark Act 
Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). The mark appearing on the specimen and in the drawing must match; that is, 
the mark in the drawing “must be a substantially exact representation of the mark” on the specimen. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.51(a)-(b); TMEP §807.12(a).
 
The drawing of the mark is "ALBERT, TEXAS".  The specimens for International Class 16  and 25 and 
the second representation on the specimen for International Class 21 show the mark as "ALBERT, TX" 
with the abbreviation "TX" instead of the full word "TEXAS". The first representation of the mark on 
the specimen for International Class 21 and the mark at the bottom of the pages on the specimens for 
International Classes 41, 43 and 45 show the mark as "ALBERT TEXAS" without the 
comma. Applicant has thus failed to provide the required evidence of use of the mark in commerce. See 
TMEP §807.12(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Submit a new drawing of the mark that shows the mark on the specimen 
and, if appropriate, an amendment of the description and/or color claim that agrees with the 
new drawing. See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b).” Applicant may amend the mark in the drawing 
to match the mark on the specimen but may not make any other changes or amendments 
that would materially alter the drawing of the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b); TMEP 
§807.14. All specimens for each class in the application must match the drawing. 
 
(2)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) for each 
applicable international class that (a) shows the mark in the drawing in actual use in 
commerce for the goods and/or services in the application or amendment to allege use, and 
(b) was in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or 
prior to the filing of an amendment to allege use.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
For more information about drawings and instructions on how to satisfy these response options using 
the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Drawing webpage.4.       Specimen Does Not Show Use With Identified Goods in International Classes 16  and 25 - 
Registration Refused
 
Specimen does not show use in specific class(es).  Registration is refused because the specimen does 
not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in connection with any of the goods and/or 
services specified in International Class(es) 16 and 25.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 
1876-79 (TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An application based on 
Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in 
commerce for each international class of goods and/or services identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a); see In re Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013). 
 
The goods in International Class 21 are "Dishware" and the goods in International Class 25 are "Hats; 
Tee shirts." The specimen for International Class 21 shows a tumbler and the specimen for International 
Class 25 shows a tank. A “tumbler” as “a drinking glass, originally with a rounded bottom,” while 
“dishware” is “dishes, as of glass, plastic, or china, used in serving food.” See attached definitions from 
the online American Heritage Dictionary. A “tee shirt” is a shirt with short sleeves, while a tank is a 
shirt that is sleeveless. See attached definitions from the online American Heritage Dictionary. The 
specimens show goods that are different than those in the identification because a tumbler is for 
drinking, not serving food, and a tank is a shirt without sleeves, while the identification specifies shirts 
with sleeves. 
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the 
goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.”  The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawingan amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before 
publication.  This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, 
including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage. 
 
5.          Specimen Does Not Show Service Mark Use for International Classes 41, 43 and 45 - 
Registration Refused 
 
Registration is refused in International Classes 41, 43 and 45 because the applied-for mark, as used on 
the specimen of record, is used only as a trade name to identify applicant’s business; it does not 
function as a service mark to indicate the source of applicant’s services and to identify and distinguish 
them from others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, 3, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1053, 1127; see In re 
Walker Process Equip. Inc., 233 F.2d 329, 332, 110 USPQ 41, 43-44 (C.C.P.A. 1956); TMEP 
§§904.07(b), 1301.02(a). Although a designation may function as both a trade name and a service 
mark, the Trademark Act does not provide for registration of matter that functions solely as a trade 
name. In re Univar Corp., 20 USPQ2d 1865, 1866-67 (TTAB 1991); TMEP §1202.01.
 
The determination as to whether a trade name also functions as a service mark is based on the manner 
in which the applied-for mark is used on the specimen or any other evidence of use, as well as the 
probable impact of such use on purchasers. See In re Univar Corp., 20 USPQ2d at 1867; In re The 
Signal Cos., 228 USPQ 956, 957 (TTAB 1986); TMEP §1202.01. In this case, the specimen shows the 
applied-for mark used only as the name of the business entity making a copyright claim at the bottom 
of the page, and not as an indicator of the source of applicant's services. 
 
Whether a designation functions as a mark depends on the commercial impression it makes on the 
relevant public; that is, whether consumers would be likely to regard it as a source-indicator for the 
services. See In re The Ride, LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 39644, at *6 (TTAB 2020) (quoting In re Eagle Crest 
Inc., 96 USPQ2d 1227, 1229 (TTAB 2010)); In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1879 
(TTAB 2017); TMEP §1301.02. The specimen and any other relevant evidence of use is reviewed to 
determine whether an applied-for mark is being used as a service mark. See In re The Ride, LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 39644, at *6 (quoting In re Eagle Crest Inc., 96 USPQ2d at 1229); TMEP §1301.02.
 
Not every designation used in the advertising or performance of services functions as a service mark, 
even though it may have been adopted with the intent to do so. In re The Ride, LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 
39644, at *6 (quoting Am. Velcro, Inc. v. Charles Mayer Studios, Inc., 177 USPQ 149, 154 (TTAB 
1973)); see TMEP §1301.02. Thus, a designation is registrable “only if it functions as an identifier of 
the source of applicant’s [] services.” In re The Ride, LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 39644, at *5 (quoting In re 
DePorter, 129 USPQ2d 1298, 1299 (TTAB 2019)); see TMEP §1301.02.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) wasin actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows proper service mark use for the 
services in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified substitute specimen” is 
a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in a signed affidavit or 
supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or new, or originally 
submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the 
filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.” The 
substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between 
the mark and the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) 
a photograph of business signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the 
sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP 
§1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must 
include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself,
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) for which no 
specimen is required before publication. See TMEP §806.03(c). This includes withdrawing 
an amendment to allege use, if one was filed. This option will later necessitate additional 
fee(s) and filing requirements, including a specimen.
 
To amend the basis from Section 1(a) to Section 1(b), applicant must submit the following 
statement, verified with an affidavit or signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: 
“Applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce and had a bona 
fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the application filing date.” 37 C.F.R. 
§2.34(a)(2); TMEP §806.01(b); see 15 U.S.C. §1051(b); 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1).
 
To withdraw an amendment to allege use, applicant must make a statement in the record 
requesting that the amendment to allege use be withdrawn.
 
For more information about the response options above and instructions on how to submit a different 
specimen using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
6.          Applicant's Domicile Address Required 
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record identifies 
“c/o” or in “care of” another party’s address and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal 
place of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). 
The application lists the same address for the applicant and the attorney of record, and the attached 
from https://haylegal.com/contact-us/ shows that the address "611 W 5th St Suite 300 Austin TX 
78701" is the address of The Hay Legal Group, PLLC. A domicile address must identify either (1) the 
permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an individual applicant resides and intends to be 
the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal place of business, which is the juristic applicant’s 
headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  
See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a). All applications must include the applicant’s domicile 
address, which is required for a complete application. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.22(a)(1), 2.32(a)(2), 2.189.
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicileas “c/o” or in “care of” another party’s address. In most cases, an address that is listed as “c/o” or in 
“care of” another party’s address is not acceptable as a domicile address because it does not identify the 
location of applicant’s headquarters where the entity’s senior executives or officers ordinarily direct 
and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1).
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide (1) documentation showing that the listed 
address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that applicant has no 
fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §601.01(b)-(b)(1).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s domicile address. Applicant should provide the 
most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP 
§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
