The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.Issue date:  August 22, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
NO CONFLICTING MARKS: 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
AMEND ID TO AVOID DECEPTIVENESS REFUSAL: 
 
Applicant’s mark includes the wording “silk”, which indicates that applicant’s goods have and/or 
exhibit, (or will have and/or will exhibit) the following feature or characteristic: 
 
The 
goods 
are 
or 
will 
be 
"made 
of 
silk".  See 
attachments 
from https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/silk.
•
 
"Silk" is "a fine lustrous fiber composed mainly of fibroin and produced by certain insect larvae to form 
cocoons, especially the strong, elastic, fibrous secretion of silkworms used to make thread and 
fabric."  See attachments from https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=silk.
 
This feature or characteristic is considered desirable for applicant’s goods. Please note the following:
 
https://www.qehomelinens.com/blog/8-features-and-benefits-of-silk/ - The benefits of silk are it 
is "soft & luxurious", "naturally sourced", "thermoregulating", "strong and durable", 
"hypoallergenic", and "moisturizing & non-inflammatory".   
1. 
https://www.ageberry.com/great-benefits-of-pure-silk-fabric/ - "Great benefits of silk fabric".  
"Silk fabric has an incredibly smooth surface, and is extremely soft, and pleasant to touch." "Silk 
is the most hypoallergenic of all fabrics." 
2. 
https://lalouettesilk.com/blog/the-benefits-of-silk/ -  
3. 
 
"It’s Naturally Hypoallergenic (and Good for Your Skin!)" 
•
"It’s Recyclable and Biodegradable" 
•
"It Warms You Up in the Winter" 
•
"It Keeps You Cool in the Summer" 
•
"It’s Strong and Durable" 
•
"It’s Luxurious, Shiny and Soft"             
•
 
See attached internet evidence.  
 
However, if some or all of the goods do not (or will not) in fact have or exhibit this feature or 
characteristic, then registration may be refused because the mark consists of or includes deceptive 
matter in relation to the identified goods. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(a); In re Budge Mfg. Co., 857 F.2d 773, 
8 USPQ2d 1259 (Fed. Cir. 1988); TMEP §1203.02-.02(b).
 
To avoid such refusal, applicant may amend the identification to specify that the goods possess thisrelevant feature or characteristic. See TMEP §§1203.02(e)(ii), (f)(i), 1402.05 et seq. However, merely 
amending the identification to exclude goods with the named feature or characteristic will not avoid a 
deceptiveness refusal. TMEP §1203.02(f)(i).
 
Therefore, applicant may amend the identification to the following, if accurate:  
 
Class 24: Bedding, namely, bed skirts, bed spreads, bed sheets, bed blankets, bed covers, 
pillowcases, and shams; all of the aforementioned goods made in whole or substantial part of 
silk 
•
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS: 
 
Class 24 -
 
In Class 24, applicant's identification is: “Bedding, namely, bed skirts, bed spreads, sheets, blankets, 
covers, pillowcases, shams, and headwraps.”  
 
The following wording is unacceptable:
 
"Sheets" is indefinite.  The type of sheets must be stated.  See below for suggestion.  
 
"Blankets" is indefinite. The type of blankets must be stated.  See below for suggestion. 
 
"Covers" is indefinite.  The type of covers must be stated.  See below for suggestion.  
 
"Headwraps" is indefinite.  The type of headwraps must be stated.  See below for suggestion. 
 
Classification of goods and services is a purely administrative matter within the sole discretion of the 
USPTO. See In re Faucher Indus. Inc., 107 USPQ2d 1355, 1357 (TTAB 2013) (quoting In re Tee-Pak, 
Inc., 164 USPQ 88, 89 (TTAB 1969)).
 
Taking the above together, applicant may adopt the following:
 
Class 24: Bedding, namely, bed skirts, bed spreads, bed sheets, bed blankets, bed covers, pillowcases, 
and shams; all of the aforementioned goods made in whole or substantial part of silk
 
Class 25: Clothing head wraps made in whole or substantial part of silk
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.  
 
Applicant's goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or servicesare deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTI-CLASS REQUIREMENTS: 
 
The application identifies goods in more than one international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy 
all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act Section 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee already paid (view 
the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that are 
classified in at least 2 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only 1 class.  
Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or 
restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
FEES FOR ADDITIONAL CLASSES: 
 
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.
 
DOMICILE INQUIRY: 
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record is for a 
third-party commercial mail receiving agency and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal 
place of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). 
A domicile address must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place 
an individual applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal 
place of business, which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as an Ohio limited liability company and specifies 
applicant’s domicile address as follows: 
 
40 Grace Drive, Unit 202 
•
            Powell OH 43065 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
 
This address has been identified as a commercial mail receiving agency by the U.S. Postal ServiceCoding Accuracy Support System (CASS) and thus does not appear to be applicant’s headquarters 
where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1). Commercial mail receiving agencies are private businesses that 
accept mail from the U.S. Postal Service on behalf of third parties.
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide (1) documentation showing that the listed 
U.S. domicile address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that 
applicant has no fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §§601.01(b)-(b)(1), 803.05(a).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s U.S. domicile address. Applicant should provide 
the most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP 
§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118585
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.

(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
