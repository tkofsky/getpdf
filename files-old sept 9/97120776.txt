NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Section 2(d) Partial Refusal – Likelihood of Confusion
•
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive
•
Advisory: Section 2(f) Acquired Distinctiveness 
•
Requirement: Identification and Classification of Goods
•
Advisory:  Multiple-Class Application Requirements  
•
 
SECTION 2(d) PARTIAL REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION 
The stated refusal refers to International Class 1 only and does not bar registration in the other class.
 
Applicant seeks to register HURRICANE BAND for, in relevant part: International Class 001: 
Adhesive roofing strips
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark inU.S. Registration Nos. HURRICANE FORCE. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
RELATEDNESS OF THE GOODS 
 
The applicant identifies the following goods: 
 
International Class 001: Adhesive roofing strips
 
Registrant identifies the following goods: 
 
International Class 001: roofing adhesives
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use. See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).
 
In this case, the registration uses broad wording to describe roofing adhesives, which presumably 
encompasses all goods of the type described, including applicant’s more narrow adhesive roofing 
strips. See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., 
Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s 
goods are legally identical. See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) 
(citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 
(C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball 
Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class ofpurchasers.” In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods  are related.
 
SIMILARITY OF THE MARKS 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.” 
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b). The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks. In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 
(TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP 
§1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 
2014).  
Where the goods and/or services of an applicant and registrant are “similar in kind and/or closely 
related,” the degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding of likelihood of 
confusion is not as great as in the case of diverse goods and/or services.  In re J.M. Originals Inc., 6 
USPQ2d 1393, 1394 (TTAB 1987); see Shen Mfg. Co. v. Ritz Hotel Ltd., 393 F.3d 1238, 1242, 73 
USPQ2d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2004); TMEP §1207.01(b).  Here the goods are legally identical and 
thus highly related.
 
Applicant has applied for the standard character mark HURRICANE BAND and the cited registration 
is the standard character mark HURRICANE FORCE.  The marks begin with the same first word, and 
results in marks with a highly similar sound, appearance, and connotation, being used on highly similar 
goods.  This results in marks with an overall similar commercial impression.
 
Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any trademark 
or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 
F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between VEUVE 
ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent 
feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate 
Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding 
similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because “consumers 
must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 
128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial words is 
particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”).Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of 
terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See 
Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), 
aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 
1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH 
confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM 
and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).  
 
Because the marks are similar in appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression, the marks 
are confusingly similar. And because the marks are confusingly similar and the goods are related, there 
is a likelihood of confusion to relevant consumers, and therefore registration is refused. 
 
Applicant should note the following additional ground for refusal.
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Applicant has applied for the mark "HURRICANE BAND" for: 
 
International Class 001: Adhesive roofing strips
International Class 019: Roofing shingles 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a function and purpose of 
applicant’s goods.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 
1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s goods 
and/or services, not in the abstract. DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 
675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b). “Whether 
consumers could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the 
test.” In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).
 
HURRICANE is defined in the attached Merriam-Webster dictionary as "a tropical cyclone with winds 
of 74 miles (119 kilometers) per hour or greater that is usually accompanied by rain, thunder, and 
lightning, and that sometimes moves into temperate latitudes" and BAND is defined as "a strip serving 
to join or hold things together".  This shows the term HURRICANE describes the goods because their 
function is to resist hurricanes and BAND describes the goods because they have a literal strip or band 
of adhesive.
 
Finally, applicant's own brochure clearly states that the HURRICANE BAND and the WEATHER-
TITE BAND are literal strips and that the goods are designed to withstand the "wind speed found in aCategory 4 Hurricane".
 
For purposes of evaluating a trademark, material obtained from the Internet is generally accepted as 
competent evidence. See In re Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d 960, 966, 82 USPQ2d 1828, 1833 
(Fed. Cir. 2007); In re Reed Elsevier Props., Inc., 482 F.3d 1376, 1380, 82 USPQ2d 1378, 1381 (Fed. 
Cir. 2007); TBMP §1208.03; TMEP §710.01(b).
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods and/or services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not 
registrable. In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re 
Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as 
hypodermic, aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 
(TTAB 2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner 
that is an integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods is the combined mark registrable. See In re 
Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 
549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In 
re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
goods and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods. 
Specifically, the goods are a roofing strip or roofing shingle with an adhesive strip, all designed to 
withstand a hurricane. 
 
For the reasons stated above, applicant's mark is merely descriptive of the applied-for goods and 
registration is refused. 
 
ADVISORY: SECTION 2(f) ACQUIRED DISTINCTIVENESS
 
In response to the Section 2(e)(1) refusal, applicant may assert a claim that the applied-for mark has 
acquired distinctiveness under Trademark Act Section 2(f). Applicant may respond by submitting (1) 
actual evidence (such as verified statements of long term use, advertising and sales expenditures, 
examples of advertising, affidavits and declarations of consumers, customer surveys) and/or (2) a 
verified statement of applicant’s five years’ use in commerce. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(f); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.41(a)(2)-(3); TMEP §1212.08.
 
To establish acquired distinctiveness based on use in commerce, an applicant may rely only on use in 
commerce that may be regulated by the U.S. Congress. See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(f), 1127. Use solely in a 
foreign country or between two foreign countries is not evidence of acquired distinctiveness in the 
United States. TMEP §§1010, 1212.08; see In re Rogers, 53 USPQ2d 1741, 1746-47 (TTAB 1999).
 
Extrinsic evidence of acquired distinctiveness. This evidence must demonstrate that the relevant 
public understands the primary significance of the mark as identifying the source of applicant’s product 
or service rather than identifying the product or service itself. In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 
1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1422 (Fed. Cir. 2005).When determining whether the evidence shows the mark has acquired distinctiveness, the trademark 
examining attorney will consider the following six factors: (1) association of the mark with a particular 
source by actual purchasers (typically measured by customer surveys linking the name to the source); 
(2) length, degree, and exclusivity of use; (3) amount and manner of advertising; (4) amount of sales 
and number of customers; (5) intentional copying; and (6) unsolicited media coverage. See Converse, 
Inc. v. ITC, 909 F.3d 1120, 1120, 128 USPQ2d 1538, 1546 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (“the Converse factors”). 
“[N]o single factor is determinative.” In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d at 1300, 75 USPQ2d at 1424; 
see TMEP §§1212.06 et seq. Rather, all factors are weighed together in light of all the circumstances to 
determine whether the mark has acquired distinctiveness. In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d at 1300, 75 
USPQ2d at 1424.
 
Verified statement of five years’ use in commerce. To amend the application to assert Section 2(f) 
based on five years’ use, applicant should provide (1) information regarding the length of use of the 
mark in commerce and/or dates of use, and (2) the following written statement claiming acquired 
distinctiveness, if accurate:
 
The mark has become distinctive of the goods and/or services through the applicant’s 
substantially exclusive and continuous use of the mark in commerce that the U.S. 
Congress may lawfully regulate for at least the five years immediately before the date of 
this statement.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §1052(f); 37 C.F.R. §2.41(a)(2); TMEP §§1212.05(d), 1212.08. This statement must be 
verified with an affidavit or signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20. 37 C.F.R. §2.41(a)(2); TMEP 
§1212.05(d); see 37 C.F.R. §2.193(e)(1).
 
Applicant is advised that, if the application is amended to seek registration on the Principal Register 
under Trademark Act Section 2(f) or on the Supplemental Register, applicant will be required to 
disclaim “BAND” because such wording appears to be generic in the context of applicant’s goods 
and/or services. See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Wella Corp., 565 F.2d 143, 144, 196 USPQ 7, 8 
(C.C.P.A. 1977); In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 USPQ 766, 768 (TTAB 1986); TMEP 
§1213.03(b).
 
Applicant may submit a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “BAND” apart from the mark as shown.
 
TMEP §1213.08(a)(i).
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusals by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusals, applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
REQUIREMENT: IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS 
 
Applicant must clarify the wording in the identification of goods because it is indefinite and too broad.See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording "adhesive roofing strips" is 
indefinite because it does not make clear the nature of the goods or their function and "roofing 
shingles" is indefinite because the material is not specified.  Further, all this wording could identify 
goods in more than one international class.  Roofing adhesives themselves are in Class 1, but adhesive 
roofing sealants are in Class 17, and roofing itself and roofing shingles are in Class 6 or Class 19, 
depending on whether it is metal or non-metal. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate (additions are shown in bold, deletions are 
in strike-through):

ADVISORY: MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
 
The application identifies goods in more than two international classes; therefore, applicant must satisfy 
all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act Sections 1(b) and 44:
 
(1)  List the goods by their international class number in consecutive numerical order, starting 
with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fees already paid (view 
the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods that are classified in at least 
3 classes; however, applicant submitted fees sufficient for only 2 classes.  Applicant must either 
submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or restrict the application 
to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Sections 1(b) and 44 multiple-class application and how to 
satisfy the requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see 
the Multiple-class Application webpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120776
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
