Mark:  SCHOOLYARD
Correspondence Address:  
NORMAN E. LEHRER 
NORMAN E. LEHRER, P.C. 
52 BERLIN ROAD 
SUITE 1000 
CHERRY HILL NJ 08034 UNITED STATES
Applicant:  School Outfitters, LLC
Reference/Docket No. 7427-31
Correspondence Email Address:  patentsnj@yahoo.comNONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH RESULTS
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL – MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature of Applicant’s goods.  
Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods.  TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 
874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl& Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 
1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 
USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 
U.S. 538, 543 (1920)). 
 
The applicant's mark is SCHOOLYARD for "Outdoor furniture; Plastic furniture for gardens; Non-
metal storage boxes of plastic for general use".
 
Here, the wording "SCHOOLYARD" is defined as "the area next to or surrounding a school where 
students typically play games or sports" (See attached evidence from merriam-webster.com).  In 
addition, the application identifies the goods as "Outdoor furniture; Plastic furniture for gardens; Non-
metal storage boxes of plastic for general use".  Moreover, the attached evidence indicates that furniture 
is commonly used in, and designed for, schoolyards, and the term "SCHOOLYARD" is commonly 
used in relation to outdoor furniture in the marketplace (See attached evidence from scheucherparket.at, 
langevinschoolyard.wordpress.com, 
couriermail.com, 
timesofmalta.com, 
nola.se, 
out-sider.dk, 
clauswiersma.nl, spruceandgander.com, yankodesign.com, and cw-global.net).  In this case, thewording "SCHOOLYARD" immediately conveys and merely describes a feature or purpose of 
applicant's identified goods, namely, furniture for schoolyards where students play.   
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
 
Supplemental Register Advisory
 
Although an amendment to the Supplemental Register would normally be an appropriate response to 
this refusal, such a response is not appropriate in the present case.  The instant application was filed 
under Trademark Act Section 1(b) and is not eligible for registration on the Supplemental Register until 
an acceptable amendment to allege use meeting the requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been timely 
filed.  37 C.F.R. §2.47(d); TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03.
 
If applicant files an acceptable allegation of use and also amends to the Supplemental Register, the 
application effective filing date will be the date applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 
37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for an amendment to allege use.  TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b).  
In addition, the undersigned trademark examining attorney will conduct a new search of the USPTO 
records for conflicting marks based on the later application filing date.  TMEP §§206.01, 1102.03.
 
To amend the application filing basis from an intent-to-use application under Trademark Act Section 
1(b) to a use in commerce basis under Section 1(a), applicant must file, prior to approval of the mark 
for publication, an amendment to allege use that satisfies the requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.76.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1051(c); 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(8); TMEP §§806.01(b), 1103.
 
The following must be submitted in an amendment to allege use in order to amend an application to use 
in commerce under Section 1(a):
 
1)     The following statements:  “Applicant believes applicant is the owner of the mark” and “the 
mark is in use in commerce.”
 
2)     The date of first use of the mark anywhere on or in connection with the goods and/or 
services.
 
3)     The date of first use of the mark in commerce as a trademark or service mark.
 
4)     The goods specified in the application.
 
5)     A specimen showing how applicant uses the mark in commerce for each class of goods for 
which use is being asserted.  If a single specimen supports multiple classes, applicant should 
indicate which classes the specimen supports rather than providing multiple copies of the same 
specimen.
 
6)     A filing fee of $100 per class for each international class of goods for which use is being 
asserted 
(current 
fee 
information 
should 
be 
confirmed 
at 
http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/tm_fee_info.jsp).
 
7)     Verification of the above (1) through (4) requirements in an affidavit or signed declarationunder 37 C.F.R. §2.20.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(2), 2.56, 2.76(b); TMEP §§1104.08, 1104.10(b)(v).
 
An amendment to allege use may be filed online at http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/teas/index.jsp.  
An amendment to allege use is not considered a response to an Office action.  37 C.F.R. §2.76(h); 
TMEP §1104.  Applicant must file a separate response to any outstanding Office action.  TMEP §1104; 
see 37 C.F.R. §2.76(h). 
 
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action.  
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action.  See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.  The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails 
can be used for informal communications and are included in the application record.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(c), 2.191; TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120667
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
