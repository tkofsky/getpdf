SUMMARY OF ISSUES
 
Disclaimer requirement
•
Clarification of domicile address required
•
Requirement for acceptable identification of goods and services
•
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIREMENT 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “HOME” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The identification of goods and services indicates the field includes home renovation, home repair, and 
home improvement.  Thus, the wording HOME describes a field of use of the goods and services.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “HOME” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove the 
disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.
 
If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire mark. 
See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1041, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005); TMEP 
§1213.01(b).
 
 
CLARIFICATION OF DOMICILE ADDRESS REQUIRED 
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record identifies 
a mail forwarding service and virtual office and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal place 
of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1).   As 
the attachments show, the address is for a virtual office with mail receipt and forwarding services.   A 
domicile address must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an 
individual applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal placeof business, which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a). All 
applications must include the applicant’s domicile address, which is required for a complete 
application. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.22(a)(1), 2.32(a)(2), 2.189.
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as a juristic entity - limited liability company - and 
specifies applicant’s domicile as a post office box or mail forwarding service instead of a street address. 
In most cases, a post office box or mail forwarding service is not acceptable as a domicile address 
because it does not identify the location of applicant’s headquarters where the entity’s senior executives 
or officers ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP 
§601.01(b)(1).
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide (1) documentation showing that the listed 
address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that applicant has no 
fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §601.01(b)-(b)(1).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s domicile address. Applicant should provide the 
most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP 
§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.
 
REQUIREMENT FOR ACCEPTABLE IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICESThe identification of goods and services is indefinite and must be clarified because it lacks the 
specificity required by the office or is otherwise unacceptable as noted below.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.  The USPTO has the discretion to determine the degree of particularity 
needed to clearly identify goods and/or services covered by a mark. In re SICPA Holding, 2021 
USPQ2d 613, at *4 (TTAB 2021) (quoting In re Omega SA, 494 F.3d 1362, 1365, 83 USPQ2d 1541, 
1543-44 (Fed. Cir. 2007)). Accordingly, the USPTO requires the description of goods and/or services 
in a U.S. application to be specific, definite, clear, accurate, and concise. In re tapio GmbH, 2020 
USPQ2d 11387, at *6 (TTAB 2020) (quoting In re Cordua Rests., Inc., 823 F.3d 594, 605, 118 
USPQ2d 1632, 1639 (Fed. Circ. 2016)); TMEP §1402.01.
 
The identifications for software, SAAS, and PASS in International Classes 009 and 042 are indefinite 
and must be clarified to specify the purpose or function of the software in addition to the content or 
field of use already specified. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). The USPTO 
requires such specificity in order for a trademark examining attorney to examine the application 
properly and make appropriate decisions concerning possible conflicts between the applicant’s mark 
and other marks. See In re N.A.D. Inc., 57 USPQ2d 1872, 1874 (TTAB 2000); TMEP §1402.03(d).
 
Further, please note that most of the consulting services are unclear as there are a variety of fields and it 
is uncertain what field the type of consulting is offered.   This wording is indefinite because it does not 
specify the subject matter of the services. Further, this wording could identify services in more than one 
international class.
 
Consulting services are classified according to the subject matter of the consulting service; for example, 
“business management consultancy” is classified in International Class 35 and “computer technology 
consultancy” is classified in International Class 42. TMEP §1402.11(e).
 
Suggested Amendments 
 
Suggested amendments appear below in bold, explanatory information appears in brackets and is not 
part of the identification, and matter to be deleted, if any, is struck through.  Please note that these 
suggestions are illustrative and not exhaustive.  Applicant should refer to the Identification Manual

Advisory 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e). Additionally, for applications filed under Trademark Act Section 
66(a), the scope of the identification for purposes of permissible amendments is limited by the 
international class assigned by the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(International Bureau); and the classification of goods and/or services may not be changed from that 
assigned by the International Bureau. 37 C.F.R. §2.85(d); TMEP §§1401.03(d), 1904.02(b). Further, in 
a multiple-class Section 66(a) application, classes may not be added or goods and/or services 
transferred from one existing class to another. 37 C.F.R. §2.85(d); TMEP §1401.03(d).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
