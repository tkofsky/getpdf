Mark:  DEREK SANDERS
Correspondence Address:  
LAUREN A. DIENES-MIDDLEN 
WORLD WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENT, INC.

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Consent Required 
•
 
Consent Required 
 
The applied-for mark includes the name of the following individual(s) applicant(s): “DEREK 
SANDERS” However, this individual(s) did not sign the application and the application does not 
include a written consent personally signed by this individual(s). To register a mark that consists of or 
comprises the name of a particular living individual, including a first name, pseudonym, stage name, or 
nickname, an applicant must provide a written consent personally signed by the named individual. 15 
U.S.C. §1052(c); TMEP §§813, 1206.04(a). Consent to registration is presumed only when the 
particular individual identified in the mark is also the person who signed the application. Alford Mfg. 
Co. v. Alfred Elecs., 137 USPQ 250, 250 (TTAB 1963), aff’d, 333 F.3d 912, 142 USPQ 168 (C.C.P.A. 
1964); TMEP §1206.04(b).
 
Because the individual(s) named in the mark did not sign the application and the application did not 
include a proper written consent, applicant must provide a statement that the name(s) in the mark 
identifies a particular living individual(s) and a written consent to register the name(s). See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(c); TMEP §§813.01(a)-(b), 1206.04(a), 1206.05.
 
A name in a mark identifies a particular living individual if the person bearing the name will be 
associated with the mark as used on the goods or services because he or she is “publicly connected with 
the business in which the mark is being used.” In re Hoefflin, 97 USPQ2d 1174, 1175-76 (TTAB 
2010). A person may be publicly connected with the business in which the mark is being used if he or 
she is well known in the relevant field of goods or services, is associated in some manner with the 
entity using the mark (e.g., the named individual is the president of the entity), or is actually connected 
to the goods or services at issue (e.g., the named individual invented the relevant product). See Krause 
v. Krause Publ’ns Inc., 76 USPQ2d 1904, 1909-10 (TTAB 2005); In re New John Nissen Mannequins, 
227 USPQ 569, 570 (TTAB 1985); Reed v. Bakers Eng’g & Equip. Co., 100 USPQ 196, 199-200 (PTO 
1954); 
TMEP 
§1206.02. The 
attached 
evidence 
from https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Derek_Sanders shows that a particular living individual 
bearing the name is associated with the mark and services. 
 
 
Accordingly, applicant must submit both of the following:
 
(1)        The following statement: “The name(s) shown in the mark identifies a 
living individual(s) whose consent(s) to register is made of record.” If the name is a 
pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, applicant must provide the following statement: 
“_______________" identifies "___________", a living individual whose consent is of 
record.”
 
(2)        A written consent, personally signed by the named individual(s), asfollows: 
“I, "___________", 
consent 
to 
the 
use 
and 
registration 
of 
my 
name, "___________", as a trademark and/or service mark with the USPTO.”
 
For an overview of the requirements for names appearing in marks, and instructions on how to satisfy 
this requirement using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see 
the Name/Portrait/Signature of Particular Living Individual in Mark webpage.

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status &

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
