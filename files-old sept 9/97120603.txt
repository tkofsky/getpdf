NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issues below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKSThe trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Foreign Registration Certificate Required
•
Amendment to the Identification of Goods Required  
•
Multi-Class Application Requirements
•
 
 
FOREIGN REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE REQUIRED
 
The application specifies Trademark Act Section 44(d) as the sole filing basis and indicates that 
applicant intends to rely on Section 44(e) as a basis for registration; however no copy of a foreign 
registration was provided. See 15 U.S.C. §1126(d), (e).
 
An application with a Section 44(e) basis must include a true copy, photocopy, certification, or certified 
copy of a foreign registration from an applicant’s country of origin. 15 U.S.C. §1126(e); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §§1004, 1004.01, 1016. In addition, the applicant’s country of origin must be a 
party to a convention or treaty relating to trademarks to which the United States is also a party, or must 
extend reciprocal registration rights to nationals of the United States by law. 15 U.S.C. §1126(b); 
TMEP §§1002.01, 1004.
 
Therefore, applicant must provide a copy of the foreign registration from applicant’s country of origin 
when it becomes available. TMEP §1003.04(a). A copy of a foreign registration must consist of a 
document issued to an applicant by, or certified by, the intellectual property office in applicant’s 
country of origin. TMEP §1004.01. If applicant’s country of origin does not issue registrations or 
Madrid Protocol certificates of extension of protection, the applicant may submit a copy of the Madrid 
Protocol international registration that shows that protection of the international registration has been 
extended to applicant’s country of origin. TMEP §1016. In addition, applicant must also provide an 
English translation if the foreign registration is not written in English. 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP 
§1004.01(a)-(b). The translation should be signed by the translator. TMEP §1004.01(b).
 
If the foreign registration is not yet available, applicant should inform the trademark examining 
attorney that the foreign application is still pending and request that the U.S. application be suspended 
until a copy of the foreign registration is available. TMEP §§716.02(b), 1003.04(a).
 
If applicant cannot satisfy the requirements of the Section 44(e) basis, applicant may amend the basis to 
Section 1(a) or 1(b), if applicant can satisfy the requirements for the new basis. See 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051(a)-(b), 1126(e); TMEP §806.03. Please note that, if the U.S. application satisfied the 
requirements of Section 44(d) as of the U.S. application filing date, applicant may retain the priority 
filing date under Section 44(d) without perfecting the Section 44(e) basis, provided there is a 
continuing valid basis for registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(3)-(4); TMEP §§806.02(f), 806.03(h).
 
 
AMENDMENT TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS REQUIRED 
 
The wording “Skin ampoule” in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified to statewhat type(s) of skin ampoule are provided. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.
 
In addition, the wording “Skin ampoule” in the identification of goods for International Class 3 must be 
clarified because it is too broad and could include goods in other international classes. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. In particular, this wording could encompass non-medicated 
skin serums in International Class 3 and also medicated serums for treatment of the skin in International 
Class 5.   
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods, but not to broaden or expand the 
goods beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods in trademark applications, please see the 
USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See TMEP 
§1402.04.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:  
 
International Class 003: Cosmetics; Cosmetic preparations for body care; Cosmetic preparations for 
skin care; Cosmetic masks; Cosmetic pads; Cosmetics and make-up; Skin toners; Skin cleanser; Facial 
cream, Sun creams; Beauty serums; Skin ampoule in the nature of non-medicated anti-aging skin 
serum; Night cream 
 
International Class 005: Skin ampoule in the nature of medicated serums for treatment of skin 
 
 
MULTI-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
 
The application identifies goods in more than one international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy 
all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act Section 44:
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee already paid (view 
the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods that are classified in at least 
two classes; however, applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only one class.  Applicant must 
either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or restrict the 
application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 44 multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
