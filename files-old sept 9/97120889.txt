The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue datebelow or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(d) Refusal - Likelihood of Confusion
•
Disclaimer Required
•
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 2831062. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-
by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 
1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 
F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those 
factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in 
every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) 
(quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 
1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 
1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 
USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the 
cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Applicant's mark is ARCHLIGHT PUBLISHING.  Registrant's mark is ARCLIGHT.  These marks are 
similar.
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
In the present case, the marks are similar in sound, appearance, and meaning because they contain the 
highly similar terms ARCHLIGHT and ARCLIGHT. Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance 
where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and 
create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 
1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 
229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re 
Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS 
confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
The only additional term in applicant's mark is descriptive and must be disclaimed, as explained later in 
this Office action, so it does not change the overall commercial impression of the mark in order to 
obviate the refusal. Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more 
significant or dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 
1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 
USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is descriptive 
of or generic for a party’s services is typically less significant or less dominant when comparing marks. 
In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).
 
Since the marks are similar in sound, appearance, and meaning, they convey similar overall commercial 
impressions.  Thus, the marks are similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.
 
Similarity or Relatedness of the Services  
 
Applicant's services are "Publishing of books, e-books, audio books, music and illustrations; 
Multimedia entertainment services in the nature of recording, production and post-production services 
in the fields of music, video, and films." Registrant's services are "motion picture film production and 
studio services; [ entertainment, namely, preparation of special effects for film and theatre; ] film 
editing services; [ rental of prerecorded video cassette tapes ]." These services are related.
 
The services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the services] emanate from 
the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 
2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the services stated in the application 
and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 
F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 
1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the application uses broad wording to describe "Multimedia entertainment services in the 
nature of recording, production and post-production services in the fields of music, video, and films," 
which 
presumably 
encompasses 
all 
services 
of 
the 
type 
described, 
including 
registrant’s narrower motion picture film production and editing services.  See, e.g., In re Solid State 
Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 
USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are legally identical.  
See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, 
Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter 
IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay 
Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are related.
 
Further, the attached Internet evidence from disney.com, walden.com, nationalgeographic.com, 
smithsonianbooks.com, 
and smithsonianchannel.com establishes 
that 
the 
same 
entity 
commonly provides the relevant services and markets the services under the same mark.  Thus, 
applicant’s and registrant’s services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, 
e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. 
Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Conclusion 
 
Given that the applied-for mark is confusingly similar to the registrant’s mark in overall commercial 
impression and that applicant’s services are related to registrant’s services, applicant is rightly refused 
registration under Section 2(d) for a likelihood of confusion.
 
It is important to note that any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in 
favor of the registrant.  TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 
F.3d 1261, 1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 
463, 464-65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1025 (Fed. Cir. 1988).  This is because the overriding concern is not 
only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the services, but to protect the registrant from 
adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer.  See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 
F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
 
If applicant responds to the refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIREDApplicant must disclaim the wording “PUBLISHING” because it is merely descriptive of a feature of 
applicant’s services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, 
Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The word "publishing" appears in the identification of services. Thus, this wording merely describes 
applicant’s services because applicant provides publishing services.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “PUBLISHING” apart from the mark as 
shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
RESPONSE GUIDELINES
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusals by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.

“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
