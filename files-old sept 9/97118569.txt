NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue datebelow or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02. 
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Sections 1, 2, 3, and 45 Refusal - Failure to Function as a Service Mark
•
Identification of Services  
•
 
SECTIONS 1, 2, 3, AND 45 REFUSAL - FAILURE TO FUNCTION AS A SERVICE MARK
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is a slogan or term that does not function as a 
trademark or service mark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and/or services and to identify 
and distinguish them from others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, 3, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1053, 
1127. In this case, the applied-for mark is a slogan or term that would be perceived by consumers as 
merely conveying information about applicant’s or similar goods and/or services. See In re Bos. Beer 
Co., 198 F.3d 1370, 1372-74, 53 USPQ2d 1056, 1058-59 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (holding THE BEST BEER 
IN AMERICA for beer and ale not registrable because it is merely a common claim of superiority); In 
re TracFone Wireless, Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 222983, at *3 (TTAB 2019) (holding UNLIMITED 
CARRYOVER for telecommunications services not registrable because it “simply provides 
information about the services”); TMEP §1202.04(a).
 
Terms and expressions that merely convey an informational message, such as common statements or 
laudatory phrases about goods and/or services, are not registrable. In re DePorter, 129 USPQ2d 1298, 
1299 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Eagle Crest, Inc., 96 USPQ2d 1227, 1229 (TTAB 2010)). Determining 
whether the term or expression functions as a trademark or service mark depends on how it would be 
perceived by the relevant public. In re Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 129 USPQ2d 1148, 1150 (TTAB 2019) 
(citing D.C. One Wholesaler, Inc. v. Chien, 120 USPQ2d 1710, 1713 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1202.04. 
When there are no limitations on the goods or services in the application, the relevant public comprises 
all potential purchasers of the goods or services. In re Team Jesus LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 11489, at *3 
(TTAB 2020) (citing In re Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 265039, at *5 (TTAB 2019)); see 
TMEP §1202.04. “The more commonly a term or expression is used, the less likely that the public will 
use it to identify only one source and the less likely that it will be recognized by purchasers as a 
trademark [or service mark].” In re Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *3 (TTAB 2019) 
(citing In re Hulting, 107 USPQ2d 1175, 1177 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §1202.04(b).
 
The attached evidence shows that this term or expression is commonly used by those in applicant'sparticular trade or industry to indicate the interior of the internet as part of the virtual 
spaces. See attached 
evidence 
from https://forumea.org/2022/07/20/study-abroad-and-the-
metaverse/; https://www.alittlebithuman.com/what-is-metaverse-and-why-is-it-the-
future/; https://techwireasia.com/2021/09/the-dawn-of-the-future-of-interaction-the-
metaverse/; https://futurism.com/augmented-reality-is-bringing-the-internet-to-
life; https://www.vice.com/en/article/93bmyv/what-is-the-metaverse-internet-technology-

d8c9f23591c8; https://www.whatisthemetaverse.info/; https://www.codingpixel.com/what-is-
metaverse-should-i-care/; https://www.shieldyourbody.com/metaverse/; 
and https://mosaicwriting.com/12-ways-the-metaverse-will-change-the-world-in-the-near-future/. 
 
Because consumers are accustomed to seeing this slogan or term used in this manner, and would take 
the words at their ordinary meaning as applied to applicant's services, consumers are likely to perceive 
the wording merely as informational matter about the services. Thus, this slogan or term would not be 
perceived as a mark that distinguishes applicant's services from those of others and identifies the source 
of applicant's services.
 
An applicant may not overcome this refusal by amending the application to seek registration on the 
Supplemental Register or asserting a claim of acquired distinctiveness under Section 2(f). In re Ocean 
Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *8; TMEP §1202.04(d); see In re TracFone Wireless, Inc., 2019 
USPQ2d 222983, at *4. Nor will submitting a substitute specimen overcome this refusal. In re Team 
Jesus LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 11489, at *5-6 (TTAB 2020) (quoting D.C. One Wholesaler, Inc. v. Chien, 
120 USPQ2d 1710, 1716 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1202.04(d).  
 
Although applicant's mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES
 
The identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because the nature of the services has 
not been identified with adequate specificity. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate:
 
Class 41: Entertainment and gaming services, namely, virtual reality [further clarify type of 
concerts, e.g., live music] concerts, virtual reality shows in the nature of [further clarify 
services, e.g., live stage events] and virtual reality games [further clarify games services, e.g., 
provided on-line from a computer network].  
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand the 
services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO's online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
RESPONSE GUIDELINESFor this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal and/or requirement in this 
Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and evidence against the refusal, 
and may have other response options if specified above. For a requirement, applicant should set forth 
the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office Actions” and the informational video 
“Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on responding.

Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
