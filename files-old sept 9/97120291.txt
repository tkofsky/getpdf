2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Mark is merely descriptive
•
Option to overcome refusal
•
 
SEARCH RESULT
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL--MARK IS MERELY DESCRIPTIVE 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes the applicant’s services.  
Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services.  TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson 
LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 
1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of 
Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)). 
 
The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s goods 
and/or services, not in the abstract.  DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 
675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b).  “Whether 
consumers could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the 
test.”  In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).  Determining the descriptiveness 
of a mark is done in relation to an applicant’s goods and/or services, the context in which the mark is 
being used, and the possible significance the mark would have to the average purchaser because of the 
manner of its use or intended use.  See In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 
1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing In re Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d 960, 
963-64, 82 USPQ2d 1828, 1831 (Fed. Cir. 2007)); TMEP §1209.01(b).  Descriptiveness of a mark is 
not considered in the abstract.  In re Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d at 963-64, 82 USPQ2d at 1831.
 
“A mark may be merely descriptive even if it does not describe the ‘full scope and extent’ of the 
applicant’s goods or services.”  In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 
1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (citing In re Dial-A-Mattress Operating Corp., 240 F.3d 1341, 1346, 57 USPQ2d 
1807, 1812 (Fed. Cir. 2001)); TMEP §1209.01(b).  It is enough if a mark describes only one significant 
function, attribute, or property.  In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 
USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b); see In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 
F.3d at 1173, 71 USPQ2d at 1371.The mark is DIGIMOMPRENEUR for marketing and online retail store services and educational 
services, podcasts, and coaching services.  The mark is merely descriptive of the services.  DIGI is the 
abbreviation for "digital" or electronic means and MOMPRENEUR refers to a woman who is a mother 
and an entrepreneur.  Please see the attached definitions.  The applicant's services are provided 
electronically or digitally for mompreneurs.  
 
Two major reasons for not protecting descriptive marks are (1) to prevent the owner of a descriptive 
mark from inhibiting competition in the marketplace and (2) to avoid the possibility of costly 
infringement suits brought by the trademark or service mark owner. In re Abcor Dev. Corp., 588 F.2d 
811, 813, 200 USPQ 215, 217 (C.C.P.A. 1978); TMEP §1209. Businesses and competitors should be 
free to use descriptive language when describing their own goods and/or services to the public in 
advertising and marketing materials. See In re Styleclick.com Inc., 58 USPQ2d 1523, 1527 (TTAB 
2001). Others providing the same or similar services would require the use of the wording(s) without 
fear of infringement suit.
 
Accordingly, the mark is not registrable on the Principal Register.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
OPTION TO OVERCOME REFUSAL--SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTER
 
Although an amendment to the Supplemental Register would normally be an appropriate response to 
this refusal(s), such a response is not appropriate in the present case.  The instant application was filed 
under Trademark Act Section 1(b) and is not eligible for registration on the Supplemental Register until 
an acceptable amendment to allege use meeting the requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been timely 
filed.  37 C.F.R. §2.47(d); TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03.
 
If applicant files an acceptable allegation of use and also amends to the Supplemental Register, the 
application effective filing date will be the date applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 
37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for an amendment to allege use.  TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b).  
In addition, the undersigned trademark examining attorney will conduct a new search of the USPTO 
records for conflicting marks based on the later application filing date.  TMEP §§206.01, 1102.03. 
 
Please note that applications on the Supplemental Register are not subject to opposition under 15 
U.S.C. §1063; TMEP § 815.  Upon approval of the mark for registration, the record will indicate that 
the mark has been "Allowed for Supplemental Registration" rather than that the mark has been 
approved for publication.  Marks on the Supplemental Register are not published for opposition, but are 
issued as registered marks on the date that they are printed in the Official Gazette.  TMEP § 815.

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
