SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Identification and Classification of Goods
•
Multiple Class Application Requirements 
•
 
IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS
 
Some of the wording in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified and/or reclassified 
because the nature of the goods is unclear, the wording is too broad, and the wording is misclassified or 
could include goods in more than one class. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant 
must amend this wording to specify the common commercial or generic name of the goods. See TMEP 
§1402.01. If the goods have no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the 
product, its main purpose, and its intended uses. See id. 
 
For example, the wording "All-purpose non-metal straps" is overly broad and must be further clarified 
because classification of such goods depends on material composition. For example, such goods could 
include both all-purpose leather straps in class 18 and all-purpose nylon straps in class 22. The wording 
"non-metal slings for loading and securing cargo" should also be further classified by indicating the 
material composition, particularly with respect to slings for securing cargo.  
 
The wording "tarps, namely, unfitted tarps for power machinery" in class 7 is definite, but 
misclassified. Such goods are properly classified in class 22 with other unfitted tarps. Applicant 
may note that tarps that are fitted for power machinery would be in class 7. Similarly, the wording 
"tarps for covering cargo in the nature of fitted tarps for covering cargo within transport vehicles" 
requires further clarification and may be misclassified in class 22, as fitted covers for vehicles or 
structural parts of vehicles are generally in class 12.  
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:
 
Class 6 is definite as submitted. 
 
Class 7: Lifting and loading equipment, namely, pulleys and blocks in the nature of pulleys being 
parts of machines and electric pulley blocks; winches; tarps, namely, unfitted tarps for power 
machinery 
 
Class 9 is definite as submitted.
 
Class 11 is definite as submitted.
 
Class 12: Metal mounting tracks for installation in cargo trailers or cargo carrying vehicles, 
namely, {specify the particular goods in class 12 by common commercial name, e.g., 
mounting brackets for holding containers adapted for vehicles}; Lifting and loading 
equipment for land vehicles, namely, belt pulleys; Cargo nets for vehicles; fitted tarps for 
covering cargo within transport vehicles in the nature of {further specify the particulargoods in class 12 by common commercial name, e.g., fitted covers for the cargo area of 
vehicles}
 
Class 18: All-purpose leather straps
 
Class 19 is definite as submitted. 
 
Class 20: Non-metal tie down fittings for use in retaining articles, namely, {specify the 
particular non-metal goods in class 20 by common commercial name, e.g., non-metal 
hooks}; Non-metal anchor plates for use in retaining cargo, namely, {specify the particular 
goods in class 20 by common commercial name, e.g., plastic storage containers for 
commercial or industrial use}; Non-metal lifting and loading equipment, namely, non-metal 
pulleys {further specify the nature of the goods in class 20, e.g., other than for machines}; 
non-metal beam stops, namely, non-metal {further specify the nature of the brackets, e.g., 
mounting} brackets for general use 
 
Class 22: All-purpose non-metal straps comprised of {specify the material composition of the 
goods in class 22, e.g., synthetic textile materials, excluding artificial leather}; {further 
specify the nature of the goods in class 22, e.g., commercial} nets for cargo control; ropes; 
non-metal slings of {further specify the material composition of the goods, e.g., rope or 
fabric} for loading and securing cargo; netting; tarps for covering cargo in the nature of fitted 
tarps for covering cargo within transport vehicles; tarps, namely, unfitted tarps for power 
machinery  
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTIPLE CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that 
are classified in at least 9 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 8 
class(es).  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the 
submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already 
paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).

requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
