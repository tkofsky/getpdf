NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
 
INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF OFFICE’S DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the Office’s database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). 
 
REQUIREMENT - IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “leather portfolios” in the identification of goods in International 
Class(es) 18 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 
1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make clear what the goods are. Further, this 
wording could identify goods  in more than one international class. For example, leather document 
portfolios and leather stationery-type portfolios are in International Class 16 and leather briefcase-type 
portfolios are in International Class 18.
 
Applicant should note that any wording in bold, in italics, underlined and/or in ALL CAPS below 
offers guidance and/or shows the changes being proposed for the identification of goods and/or 
services.  If there is wording in the applicant’s version of the identification of goods and/or services 
which should be removed, it will be shown with a line through it such as this: strikethrough.  When 
making its amendments, applicant should enter them in standard font, not in bold, in italics, underlined 
or in ALL CAPS.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 16: Leather portfolios, namely, ___ {indicate particular goods belonging in International 
Class 16, e.g., leather document portfolios, leather stationery-type portfolios}
 
Class 18: Leather portfolios, namely, ___ {indicate particular goods belonging in International Class 
18, e.g., leather briefcase-type portfolios}; luggage
 
See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.
 
An applicant may only amend an identification to clarify or limit the goods, but not to add to or 
broaden the scope of the goods.  37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); see TMEP §§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. Generally, 
any deleted goods may not later be reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e). 
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Advisory – Multiple Class Application
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that 
are classified in at least 2 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 
class(es).  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the 
submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already 
paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Response guidelines.  For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action.  For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above.  For a

Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on

action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

GENERAL GUIDANCE

Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
