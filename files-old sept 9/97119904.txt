NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(d) Refusal – Likelihood of Confusion
•
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 5833774. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.  
 
Standard of Analysis for Section 2(d) Refusal 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Facts 
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark ARTSOCKET for use on “Carpets; Rugs; Wallcoverings; 
Bath mats; Bathroom mats; Bathroom rugs; Beach mats; Floor mats for vehicles; Non-slip mats for 
baths; Stable mats for use as animal mattresses” in International Class 27. 
 
Registrant’s mark is ARTSOCKET for “Blanket throws; Canvas fabric; Cotton fabric; Duvets; Hand 
towels; Linen cloth; Pillow covers; Shower curtains; Table linen; Table pads; Throws for traveling; 
Towels; Window curtains; Woolen fabric; Woollen blanket” in International Class 24. 
 
Similarity of MarksIn a likelihood of confusion determination, the marks in their entireties are compared for similarities in 
appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression. In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 
1323, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1748 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 
746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve 
Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 
2005)); In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 
1973); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v).
 
In the present case, applicant’s mark is ARTSOCKET and registrant’s mark is ARTSOCKET. These 
marks are identical in appearance, sound, and meaning, “and have the potential to be used . . . in 
exactly the same manner.” In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), aff’d, 866 
F.3d 1315, 123 USPQ2d 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Additionally, because they are identical, these marks 
are likely to engender the same connotation and overall commercial impression when considered in 
connection with applicant’s and registrant’s respective goods. Id.
 
Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar.
 
Relatedness of Goods 
 
The compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods and/or services] 
emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Where the marks of the respective parties are identical, as in this case, the degree of similarity or 
relatedness between the goods needed to support a finding of likelihood of confusion declines. See In re 
Country Oven, Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 443903, at *5 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 
USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), aff’d, 866 F.3d 1315, 123 USPQ2d 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2017)); TMEP 
§1207.01(a); see also In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1207, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 
1993).
 
Here, the attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots of third-party websites, establishes that 
the same entity commonly provides the relevant goods under the same mark, through the same trade 
channels, which are used by the same classes of consumers in the same fields of use.   Thus, applicant’s 
and registrant’s goods are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re 
Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 
USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009). 
 
In conclusion, because the marks are identical and the goods are related, there is a likelihood of 
confusion as to the source of applicant’s goods.  Therefore, registration is refused pursuant to Section 
2(d) of the Trademark Act. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.ASSISTANCE

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
