NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
INTRODUCTION 
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH RESULTS FROM USPTO DATABASE FOR CONFLICTING MARKS 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
 
RULE 2.61(b) REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL SPECIMEN SUBMISSIONS
 
Given the wide variety and range of unrelated goods that applicant has listed in the application, 
applicant must submit additional specimens to allow for a complete and accurate examination of the 
application and assessment of the registrability of the subject mark, in accordance with Rule 2.61(b).  
37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); see TMEP §904.01(a).
 
Applicant must submit specimens demonstrating use of the mark on all the following goods:
 
Air handlers; 
1. 
Aircraft lavatories sold equipped with sanitary facilities, namely, toilets and sinks; 
2. 
Barbecue apparatus, namely, fuel starter in the nature of a metal container with a wooden handle 
into which fuel briquettes may be placed, lit, and then poured into a barbecue grill for the 
purpose of speeding up the ready to cook time of barbecue fuels; 
3. 
Cooling units comprised of cold packs, aluminum tiles, and insulated plastic bases, for cooling 
animals and pets, not for veterinary purposes; 
4. 
Filters, heaters and pumps sold in combination for use in hot tubs; 
5. 
Heated dispensing unit for tissues, towelettes, wipes, cloths and pads; 
6. 
Hydroponic growing systems comprised of light emitting diode (LED) plant grow lights, grow 
cabinets in the nature of closed environments with integrated misting chambers, and automated 
controls therefor; 
7. 
Interior environment control system for commercial buildings, namely, heaters, ventilators and 
humidifiers all sold as a unit; 
8. 
Plumbing fixtures, namely, sink sprayers; 
9. 
Refrigerated medical container for storage, transportation and cooling of medicines and 
pharmaceuticals; 
10. 
Showers and shower cubicles; 
11. 
Water treatment apparatus, namely, clarification and thickening machines for use in treatment of 
liquids in the nature of water, waste water and industrial water  
12. 
 
If applicant is unable to provide specimens to support use of these items, applicant must delete these 
entries, or amend the filing basis for those goods that were not in proper use as of the application filing 
date to an intent to use basis under Section 1(b).  This option will later necessitate additional fees and 
filing requirements such as providing a specimen for these goods at a subsequent date.
 
Failure to comply with a requirement to furnish additional specimens is grounds for refusing 
registration.  In re Harley, 119 USPQ2d 1755, 1757-58 (TTAB 2016); TMEP §814.  Merely stating 
that evidence is available on applicant’s or a third party website or providing a hyperlink of such a 
website is an insufficient response and will not make the additional specimens of record.  See In re 
Planalytics, Inc., 70 USPQ2d 1453, 1457-58 (TTAB 2004).Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
If applicant does not timely respond to this Office action, the following goods will be deleted from the 
application:
 
Air handlers; Aircraft lavatories sold equipped with sanitary facilities, namely, toilets and sinks; 
Barbecue apparatus, namely, fuel starter in the nature of a metal container with a wooden handle 
into which fuel briquettes may be placed, lit, and then poured into a barbecue grill for the 
purpose of speeding up the ready to cook time of barbecue fuels; Cooling units comprised of cold 
packs, aluminum tiles, and insulated plastic bases, for cooling animals and pets, not for 
veterinary purposes; Filters, heaters and pumps sold in combination for use in hot tubs; Heated 
dispensing unit for tissues, towelettes, wipes, cloths and pads; Hydroponic growing systems 
comprised of light emitting diode (LED) plant grow lights, grow cabinets in the nature of closed 
environments with integrated misting chambers, and automated controls therefor; Interior 
environment control system for commercial buildings, namely, heaters, ventilators and 
humidifiers all sold as a unit; Plumbing fixtures, namely, sink sprayers; Refrigerated medical 
container for storage, transportation and cooling of medicines and pharmaceuticals; Showers and 
shower cubicles; Water treatment apparatus, namely, clarification and thickening machines for 
use in treatment of liquids in the nature of water, waste water and industrial water 
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.65(a); TMEP §718.02(a).
 
In such case, the application will then proceed with the following goods only:  
 
Electric luminaries; Flexible pipes being parts of shower plumbing installations. 
 
See TMEP §718.02(a).

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120241
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
