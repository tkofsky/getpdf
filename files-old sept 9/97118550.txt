below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.

•

•
Amended Identification of Goods Required

PRIOR-FILED APPLICATIONS ADVISORY
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting registered marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 
2(d). 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02. However, marks in prior-filed pending applications may 
present a bar to registration of applicant’s mark.
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial Nos. 90144342, 90144337, and 90144342 precedes 
applicant’s filing date.  See attached referenced applications.  If one or more of the marks in the 
referenced applications register, applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act 
Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion with the registered mark(s).  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 
37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office 
action, action on this application may be suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed 
referenced applications.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
applications.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s 
right to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
Applicant must respond to the requirements below.
 
 
CLARIFICATION OF APPLICANT'S ENTITY TYPE REQUIRED
 
Applicant is identified in the application as a sole proprietorship named “fun-store”, organized in theRepublic of Korea. In addition to the applicant name and country of organization provided, however, 
applicant must also specify the name and national citizenship of the individual person who is the sole 
proprietor. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(v); TMEP §803.03(a).
 
The following format for identifying a sole proprietorship should be used:  “fun-store, a Republic of 
Korea sole proprietorship, composed of <name of individual>, a citizen of <country of citizenship>.”  
See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(v); TMEP §803.03(a).  The name of the sole proprietorship and the name of 
the individual can be the same. 
 
If, rather than a sole proprietorship, applicant is instead an individual person doing business under an 
assumed business name, then the following format should be used:  “<name of individual>, a citizen of 
<country of citizenship>, doing business as fun-store.”  TMEP §§803.02(a), 803.04.
 
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “NACRE” and "MOTHER OF PEARL" because it is merely 
descriptive of a feature or characteristic of applicant’s goods.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 
2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from Lexico shows "NACRE" means "mother-of-pearl"; and "MOTHER OF 
PEARL" means "a smooth shining iridescent substance forming the inner layer of the shell of some 
mollusks, especially oysters and abalones, used in ornamentation."  Thus, the wording merely describes 
applicant’s goods because the goods contain or are made of a smooth shining iridescent substance 
forming the inner layer of the shell of some mollusks, especially oysters and abalones, used in 
ornamentation.  See also the attached evidence from Editorialist, Dusty Old Thing, Etsy, and Ebay 
showing third-parties using the wording "NACRE" and/or "MOTHER OF PEARL" to describe goods, 
including those similar to that identified by applicant, as being made of a smooth shining iridescent 
substance forming the inner layer of the shell of some mollusks. 
 
Although applicant uses the wording "NACREH" in applicant's mark, the attached evidence from 
Lexico shows that this spelling variant does not appear in the dictionary and instead suggests the 
spelling "NACRE".  Thus, the wording “NACREH” must appear in its correct spelling, i.e., “NACRE” 
in the disclaimer. See In re Omaha Nat’l Corp., 819 F.2d 1117, 1119, 2 USPQ2d 1859, 1861 (Fed. Cir. 
1987); In re Carlson, 91 USPQ2d 1198, 1203 (TTAB 2009); TMEP §1213.08(c).
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove the 
disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use "NACRE" and "MOTHER OF 
PEARL" apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark ElectronicApplication System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire mark. 
See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1041, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005); TMEP 
§1213.01(b).
 
 
AMENDED DESCRIPTION OF MARK REQUIRED
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one uses broad, vague 
language that does not accurately describe the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. 
Descriptions must be accurate and identify all the literal and design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.37; TMEP §808.02. In this case, the description is vague because the location of the sea shell, the 
wording "NACREH" and the wording "MOTHER OF PEARL" in relation to each other is not clear.  
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate:
        
           The mark consists of a design of a sea shell to the left of the stylized wording 
"NACREH" and "MOTHER OF PEARL".  The wording "MOTHER OF PEARL" has a long 
horizontal line to the immediate left and a long horizontal line to the immediate right, all of which 
appears below "NACREH".
 
 
AMENDED IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS REQUIRED
 
Applicant’s mark includes the wording “MOTHER OF PEARL” and "NACREH" which appears to be 
an intentional misspelling of "NACRE" which means "mother of pearl".  This wording indicates that 
applicant’s goods have (or will have) the following feature or characteristic: be made of mother of 
pearl.
 
This feature or characteristic is considered desirable for applicant’s goods because mother of pearl is an 
organic-inorganic composite material, of which pearls are also made of, and is considered to be 
ornamentation material that is strong, resilient, and one-of-a-kind as no two pieces of mother of pearl 
are identical.  See the attached evidence from Editorialist and Dusty Old Thing.  However, if some or 
all of the goods do not (or will not) in fact have or exhibit this feature or characteristic, then registration 
may be refused because the mark consists of or includes deceptive matter in relation to the identified 
goods. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(a); In re Budge Mfg. Co., 857 F.2d 773, 8 USPQ2d 1259 (Fed. Cir. 1988); 
TMEP §1203.02-.02(b).
 
To avoid such refusal, applicant may amend the identification to specify that the goods possess this 
relevant feature or characteristic. See TMEP §§1203.02(e)(ii), (f)(i), 1402.05 et seq. However, merely 
amending the identification to exclude goods with the named feature or characteristic will not avoid a 
deceptiveness refusal. TMEP §1203.02(f)(i).   
 
Applicant is advised that the Office construes the wording "made in significant part of" as indicating 
that the goods contain a sufficient amount of the named ingredient or material composition to meet the 
standard for use of the term in the relevant industry.  See TMEP §§1203.02(f)(i).
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate (suggested language in bold):International Class 18:  Business card cases; Business card holders in the nature of card cases; Name 
card cases; all of the foregoing made in whole or significant part of mother of pearl
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods, but not to broaden or expand the 
goods beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).

TMEP §1402.04.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118550
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
