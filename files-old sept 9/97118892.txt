NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below to enable further prosecution of the 
application. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Identification of the goods
 
Applicant is advised that the bolded wording is not acceptable because it's a duplicate and must be 
deleted.  
 
Further guidance for the amendment of the identification is embedded or provided below, as 
appropriate. Applicant may adopt any or all of the suggestions so long as they are accurate. If applicant 
does not adopt a suggestion, then applicant must amend the identification so that it is as specific as the 
suggestions or the language found in the U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services 
Manual. 
 
The current identification of the goods is:  
 
International Class 034: Absorbent paper for tobacco pipes; Ashtrays; Lighters for smokers; Match 
Boxes; herbs for smoking; tobacco jars; Tobacco grinders; Tobacco jars; Matches; Match holders; 
Cartomizers, namely, combination electronic cigarette refill cartridges sold empty and atomizers, sold 
as a component of electronic cigarettes 
 
Applicant's goods may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those originally 
itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. 
Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting items to 
result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods or add 
goods not found or encompassed by those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 
TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification 
and is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP 
§§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any acceptable changes to the goods  will further limit scope, and once 
goods are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO's online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04. 
 
Domicile--Commercial Mail Receiving Agency Address of record
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record is for a 
third-party commercial mail receiving agency and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal 
place of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). 
A domicile address must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place 
an individual applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal 
place of business, which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
Applications must include an applicant’s domicile address because such domicile determines whether 
an applicant is required to have a U.S.-licensed attorney represent it before the USPTO. See 37 C.F.R.§§2.11(a), 2.32(a)(2); TMEP §§601, 803.05. An applicant whose domicile is located outside of the 
United States or its territories must be represented at the USPTO by an attorney who is an active 
member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a U.S. state or territory. 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); 
TMEP §601.01(a).
 
In this case, the application lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile address 
as follows: 20929 Ventura Blvd Woodland Hills CALIFORNIA 91364. This address has been 
identified as a commercial mail receiving agency by the U.S. Postal Service Coding Accuracy Support 
System (CASS) and thus does not appear to be applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or 
officers ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP 
§601.01(b)(1). A commercial mail receiving agency is a private business that accepts mail from the 
U.S. Postal Service on behalf of third parties.
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide (1) documentation showing that the listed 
U.S. domicile address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that 
applicant has no fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §§601.01(b)-(b)(1), 803.05.
 
If applicant amends the application to list a domicile street address located outside of the United States 
or its territories, applicant must appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney qualified under 37 C.F.R. §11.14 as its 
representative before the application may proceed to registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); TMEP 
§601.01(a). See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information. However, if applicant 
establishes its domicile street address is located within the United States or its territories, applicant is 
not required to appoint a qualified U.S.-licensed attorney. See TMEP §601.01(b).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support a U.S. domicile address. Applicant should provide the most 
recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for example 
one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar report; or (2) a 
current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP §601.01(b)-(b)(1); 
see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed domicile address, and the 
date of the document but should redact other personal and financial information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.
 
Response guidelines
 
Applicant should include the following information on all correspondence with the Office: (1) the name 
and law office number of the trademark examining attorney, (2) the serial number and filing date of the 
application, (3) the date of issuance of this Office action, (4) applicant's name, address, telephone 
number and e-mail address (if applicable), and (5) the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.194(b)(1); TMEP §302.03(a). 
 
If applicant does not respond to this Office action within six months of the issue/mailing date, or 
responds by expressly abandoning the application, the application process will end and the trademark 
will fail to register. See 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.65(a), 2.68(a); TMEP §§718.01, 718.02. 
Additionally, the USPTO will not refund the application filing fee, which is a required processing 
fee. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(1)(i)-(iv), 2.209(a); TMEP §405.04.
 
When an application has abandoned for failure to respond to an Office action, an applicant may timely 
file a petition to revive the application, which, if granted, would allow the application to return to active 
status. See 37 C.F.R. §2.66; TMEP §1714. The petition must be filed within two months of the date of 
issuance of the notice of abandonment and may be filed online via the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) with a $100 fee. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(15)(ii), 2.66(a)(1), (b)(1).

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118892
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
