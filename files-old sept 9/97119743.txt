SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Specimen Refusal
•
 
 
SPECIMEN REFUSAL
 
Specimen does not show use in specific class.  Registration is refused because the specimen does not 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in connection with any of the goods and/or 
services specified in International Class 028.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79 
(TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An application based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for 
each international class of goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege 
use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re 
Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013). 
 
Specifically, applicant's identification of goods includes "toy guns" in class 028. However, applicant's 
specimen shows the mark associated with a firearm that appears to be fully functional. Specifically, the 
specimen states that the goods are "suitable for any equipment made for genuine products". Thus, this 
appears to be a fully functional firearm, which is in class 013, and not a toy. Therefore, the specimen 
does not show the maker in connection with the class 028 goods. 
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual use 
in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of an 
amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the goods 
and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment toallege use.”  The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing 
an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before 
publication.  This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, 
including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119743
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the

to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
