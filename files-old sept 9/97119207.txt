Significance/Translation of the Mark
•
 
REQUIREMENT
 
Before this application can proceed in the registration process, the following issue must be addressed.
 
A.  Significance/Translation of the Mark
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must clarify whether wording in the mark 
has any particular significance, as follows:
 
(1) Industry significance. Explain whether the wording “KIZMA” in the mark has any meaning 
or significance in the trade or industry in which applicant’s goods are manufactured or provided, 
any meaning or significance as applied to applicant’s goods, or if such wording is a term of art 
within applicant’s industry.
 
(2) Geographical significance. Explain whether this wording identifies a geographic place.
 
(3) Foreign language/character significance. Explain whether this wording has any meaning in 
a foreign language. If so, submit an English translation of the foreign wording in a mark. 
 
The format for an English translation: “The English translation of “KIZMA” in the 
mark is “[specify English translation, if applicable]”. 
 
The format for when there is no English translation: “The wording “KIZMA” has no 
meaning in a foreign language.”
 
(4) Other significance. Respond to the following question:
 
Is "KIZMA" the surname of anyone associated with applicant?
 
See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(9)-(a)(10), 2.61(b); TMEP §§809-809.03, 814. If the wording has no 
significance and is not a term of art in the relevant trade or industry or as used with applicant’s goods 
and/or services, and does not have any geographical or meaning in a foreign language, or any other 
significance, applicant must provide a statement to that effect. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §814.

Application System (TEAS) response form and enter the serial number, answer “yes” to question 3, and

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119207
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
