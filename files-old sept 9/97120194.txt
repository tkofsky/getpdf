SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Recitation of services 
•
 
 
Recitation of services
The identification of services is indefinite and overly broad as to the administration services because 
financial administration is only in class 36 when it is in connection with class 36 subject matter.   Here, 
the subject matter is not clearly in class 36, especially as to human capital development.   See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must amend the identification to specify the common 
commercial or generic name of the services. See TMEP §1402.01. If the services have no common 
commercial or generic name, applicant must describe or explain the nature of the services using clear 
and succinct language. See id.
 
Applicant may adopt the following wording, if accurate:
 
Financial advisory and consultancy services, namely, financial research, evaluation, analysis, 
management, advising, and information services in the field of human capital development, private 
equity and investment management, including with respect to special purposes acquisition companies 
(SPACs) and private equity funds, in class 36 [note that the only difference between this identification 
and the original identification is that "administration" has been deleted] 
 
[clarify the nature of the administration services and classify accordingly eg  Financial advisory and 
consultancy services, namely, financial administration of retirement plans featuring private equity 
funds and investments, including with respect to special purposes acquisition companies (SPACs), in 
class 36] 
 
Note that "financial administration in the field of human capital development" does not appear to be 
logical or an actual service.   Human capital would be employees, but it is not clear how one would do 
financial administration of the development of employees.  Such appears to be inadvertently included 
and must be modified to be clear or deleted.  
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
