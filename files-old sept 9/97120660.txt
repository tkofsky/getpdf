Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that so resembles a registered mark 
that it is likely a potential consumer would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the source of the 
goods and/or services of the applicant and registrant.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  A determination of 
likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d) is made on a case-by-case basis and the factors set forth in 
In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) aid 
in this determination.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d 1344, 1349, 98 USPQ2d 
1253, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citing On-Line Careline, Inc. v. Am. Online, Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1085, 56 
USPQ2d 1471, 1474 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).  Not all the du Pont factors, however, are necessarily relevant or 
of equal weight, and any one of the factors may control in a given case, depending upon the evidence of 
record.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d at 1355, 98 USPQ2d at 1260; In re 
Majestic Distilling Co., 315 F.3d 1311, 1315, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see In re E. I. 
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d at 1361-62, 177 USPQ at 567.
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant:  similarity of the marks, similarity and nature 
of the goods and/or services, and similarity of the trade channels of the goods and/or services.  See In re 
Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Dakin’s 
Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d 1593, 1595-96 (TTAB 1999); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
COMPARISON OF THE MARKS
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Applicant's mark is LIVE RIGHT (+design).
 
The registered marks are LIVERITE, LIVRITE FITNESS CENTER, LIVERIGHT NATURALLY(+design), LIVE LIGHT LIVE RIGHT, and LIVE LIGHT LIVE RIGHT (+styl.).
 
In this case, each mark features a slight variation of the wording "LIVE RIGHT".  Marks may be 
confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases 
appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l 
Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 
USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly 
similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and 
CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
In the case of the marks "LIVRITE" and "LIVRITE FITNESS CENTER", the registered marks spells 
the wording "RIGHT" slightly differently as "RITE", but the wording still sounds the same when 
pronounced aloud.  The wording in the marks are essentially phonetic equivalents and thus sound 
similar. Similarity in sound alone may be sufficient to support a finding that the compared marks are 
confusingly similar. In re 1st USA Realty Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007) (citing 
Krim-Ko Corp. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 390 F.2d 728, 732, 156 USPQ 523, 526 (C.C.P.A. 1968)); 
TMEP §1207.01(b)(iv).
 
Moreover, although applicant’s mark does not contain the entirety of the registered marks, applicant’s 
mark is likely to appear to prospective purchasers as a shortened form of the registered marks. See In re 
Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting United States 
Shoe Corp., 229 USPQ 707, 709 (TTAB 1985)). Thus, merely omitting some of the wording from a 
registered mark may not overcome a likelihood of confusion. See In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 
1342, 94 USPQ2d 1257; In re Optica Int’l, 196 USPQ 775, 778 (TTAB 1977); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-
(iii). In this case, applicant’s mark does not create a distinct commercial impression from the registered 
mark because it contains the common wording "LIVE RIGHT", but does not add any wording that 
would distinguish it from the registered marks.  It is noted that almost all the registered marks contain 
additional wording to distinguish the mark from the other registered marks. 
 
The addition of the wording "FITNESS CENTER" and "NATURALLY" to the common wording 
"LIVE RIGHT" in two of the registered marks will not obviate a likelihood of confusion here as the 
wording is merely descriptive of, if not generic for, the relevant services.  Although marks are 
compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in creating a 
commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. 
Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or generic for a party’s services is 
typically less significant or less dominant when comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 
1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).  Therefore, the 
common iterations of the wording "LIVE RIGHT" remain the dominant portion of the registered 
marks. 
 
Moreover, the addition of a design element in some of the marks will not avoid a likelihood of 
confusion here.  When evaluating a composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion 
is normally accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, 
be remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the services. In re Aquitaine Wine 
USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks must be 
compared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is accorded 
greater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word portion has 
been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant Food, Inc. 
v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).
 
Furthermore, generally, the greater the degree of similarity between the applied-for mark and the 
registered mark, the lesser the degree of similarity between the services of the parties is required to 
support a finding of likelihood of confusion. In re C.H. Hanson Co., 116 USPQ2d 1351, 1353 (TTAB 
2015) (citing In re Opus One Inc., 60 USPQ2d 1812, 1815 (TTAB 2001)); In re House Beer, LLC, 114 
USPQ2d 1073, 1077 (TTAB 2015) (citing In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1206, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 
1688 (Fed. Cir. 1993); Time Warner Ent. Co. v. Jones, 65 USPQ2d 1650, 1661 (TTAB 2002); In re 
Opus One Inc., 60 USPQ2d at 1815); TMEP §1207.01(a).
 
COMPARISON OF THE SERVICES
 
The services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).  The compared services 
need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. 
Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 
214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only 
be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding their marketing are such that they 
could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., 
Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of entities that provide health club services, including fitness 
classes, nutrition counseling, and/or websites with information about fitness, health, and nutrition, all 
under the same mark, establishes that the same entity commonly provides the relevant services and 
markets the services under the same mark (See attached evidence from vidafitness.com, lionsgym.com, 
jimwhitefit.com, crossfit12gauge.com, and nutritionandfitnesspro.com).  The attached evidence also 
shows entities that provide health spa services, including weight loss programs or programs in the field 
of obesity, as well as fitness classes, nutrition counseling, and/or websites with information about 
fitness, 
health, 
and 
nutrition 
(See 
attached 
evidence 
from 
hhhealth.com, 
pritikin.com, 
healthandwellnessmedicalservices.com, dukehealth.com, xbodyus.com, and frederickhealth.org).  Thus, 
applicant’s and registrant’s services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, 
e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. 
Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009). 
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the services, but to 
protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer.  
See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  Therefore, any 
doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the registrant.  TMEP 
§1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1265, 62 USPQ2d 
1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 
1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).In light of the similarities between the marks and the relatedness of the services, it is likely that 
consumers who encounter the parties' services will falsely conclude that they originate from the same 
source. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusals by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  If applicant submits evidence or 
arguments in support of registration, applicant must also address the requirement below. 
 
 
SECTIONS 1 AND 45 REFUSAL - UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMENS OF USE:  MARK 
DIFFERS IN DRAWING AND SPECIMEN
 
Mark shown on drawing does not match mark on specimen. Registration is refused because the 
specimen does not show the mark in the drawing in use in commerce in International Classes 041 and 
044, which is required in the application. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 
37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). The mark appearing on the 
specimen and in the drawing must match; that is, the mark in the drawing “must be a substantially exact 
representation of the mark” on the specimen. See 37 C.F.R. §2.51(a)-(b); TMEP §807.12(a).
 
In this case, the specimen displays the mark as "LIVE RIGHT" in teal to the right of a design in teal, 
"LIVE RIGHT" in teal without a design, and "LIVE RIGHT" in teal below a design in teal. However, 
the drawing displays the mark as "LIVE RIGHT" in white below a design in white, all on a teal 
background. The mark on the specimen does not match the mark in the drawing because the orientation 
of the mark and design differ, as do the colors used. Applicant has thus failed to provide the required 
evidence of use of the mark in commerce. See TMEP §807.12(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Submit a new drawing of the mark that shows the mark on the specimen 
and, if appropriate, an amendment of the description and/or color claim that agrees with the 
new drawing. See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b).
 
The following amended description is suggested, if accurate:
 
The mark consists of the stylized wording "LIVE RIGHT" in white below 
a design reminiscent of a person with raised arms in white comprised of a series 
of three concentric curved lines in white below a downward-facing chevron in 
white, which is in turn below a miscellaneous oval shape in white.  All of the 
foregoing is on a teal background.
 
Applicant may amend the mark in the drawing to match the mark on the specimen 
but may not make any other changes or amendments that would materially alter the 
drawing of the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b); TMEP §807.14.
 
(2)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) for each 
applicable international class that (a) shows the mark in the drawing in actual use in 
commerce for the services in the application , and (b) was in actual use in commerce at

Applicant must amend the color claim and description to identify all the colors in the drawing of the 
mark. See 37 C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). 
 
A complete color claim must reference all the colors appearing in the drawing of the mark. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1); TMEP §§807.07(a) et seq. Similarly, a complete description of a mark depicted in 
color must specify where the colors appear in the literal and design elements of the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.37, 2.52(b)(1); TMEP §§807.07(a) et seq. If black, white, and/or gray represent background, 
outlining, shading, and/or transparent areas and are not part of the mark, applicant must so specify in 
the description. See TMEP §807.07(d).
 
The following color claim and description are suggested, if accurate:
 
Color claim: The colors teal and white are claimed as a feature of the mark.
 
Description: The mark consists of the stylized wording "LIVE RIGHT" in white below a 
design reminiscent of a person with raised arms in white comprised of a series of three 
concentric curved lines in white below a downward-facing chevron in white, which is in 
turn below a miscellaneous oval shape in white.  All of the foregoing is on a teal 
background.

MATTHEW J. HIMICHUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120660
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
