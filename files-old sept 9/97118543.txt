INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application and preliminary amendment have been reviewed by the assigned trademark 
examining attorney.  Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. 
§1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF OFFICE’S DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the Office’s database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
REQUIREMENT - IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
•
REQUIREMENT - COLOR CLAIM AND MARK DESCRIPTION
•
 
REQUIREMENT - IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
 
For each item specified in the submitted listing of goods, the identification indicates that the intended 
users are "men woman boys and girls." Applicant must correct and add punctuation in the identification 
to clarify the individual intended users in the lists for each of the goods. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.01(a). Proper punctuation in identifications is necessary to delineate explicitly each 
product or service within a list and to avoid ambiguity. The suggested amendment below adds in 
commas between the different intended users and also modifies the word "woman" to be the plural 
"women" in order to match the other intended user entries.  
 
Applicant should note that any wording in bold, in italics, underlined and/or in ALL CAPS below 
offers guidance and/or shows the changes being proposed for the identification of goods and/or 
services.  If there is wording in the applicant’s version of the identification of goods and/or services 
which should be removed, it will be shown with a line through it such as this: strikethrough.  When 
making its amendments, applicant should enter them in standard font, not in bold, in italics, underlined 
or in ALL CAPS.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 25: Headwear for men, women, boys and girls; Hooded sweatshirts for men, women, boys and 
girls; Jackets for men, women, boys, girls; Shirts for men, women, boys and girls; Shorts for 
men, women, boys and girls; Sweaters for men, women, boys, girls; Sweatpants for men, women, boys 
and girls; Sweatshirts for men, women, boys and girls; T-shirts for men, women, boys and girls
 
See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.
 
An applicant may only amend an identification to clarify or limit the goods, but not to add to or 
broaden the scope of the goods.  37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); see TMEP §§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. Generally, 
any deleted goods may not later be reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e). 
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
REQUIREMENT - COLOR CLAIM AND MARK DESCRIPTION 
 
Applicant must amend the color claim and description to identify all the colors in the drawing of the 
mark. See 37 C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). The following colors have been omitted 
from the color claim: black. In addition, the following colors have been omitted from the description:black.
 
A complete color claim must reference all the colors appearing in the drawing of the mark. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1); TMEP §§807.07(a) et seq. Similarly, a complete description of a mark depicted in 
color must specify where the colors appear in the literal and design elements of the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.37, 2.52(b)(1); TMEP §§807.07(a) et seq. If black, white, and/or gray represent background, 
outlining, shading, and/or transparent areas and are not part of the mark, applicant must so specify in 
the description. See TMEP §807.07(d).
 
The current color claim and mark description uses highly subjective color descriptors which must be 
replaced because generic color names must be used to describe the colors in a color claim and 
description, e.g., red, yellow, blue. TMEP §807.07(a)(i)-(ii). Furthermore, applicant must submit an 
amended description of the mark because the current one is incomplete and does not describe all the 
significant aspects of the mark, in particular, the actual wording which appears in the mark. 37 C.F.R. 
§2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. Descriptions must be accurate and identify all the literal and 
design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §2.37; TMEP §§808 et seq.  
 
The following color claim and description are suggested, if accurate:
 
Color claim: “The colors brown, tan, beige and black are claimed as a feature of the mark.”
 
Description: “The mark consists of the stylized wording "CHERRYBAEY" where the bottom of 
portion of the second letter "Y" extends under the word to underline the letters "BAE" and has 
the appearance of a cherry stem. The upper half of the letters in the wording are colored in 
tan with beige highlights at the top and the lower half of the letters, including the cherry stem 
underline, are colored in brown and the cherry stem has a tan highlight. The letters are then 
outlined in beige with an additional black outline followed by a final beige outline. The color 
white indicates transparent area and is not a part of the mark.”
 
CONCLUSION

and/or requirement in this Office action.  For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
