Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Registration Refused- Failure to Function- Widely Used Message
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is a slogan or term that does not function as a 
trademark or service mark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and/or services and to identify 
and distinguish them from others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, 3, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1053, 
1127. In this case, the applied-for mark is a commonplace term, message, or expression widely used by 
a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment. 
See In re Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 129 USPQ2d 1148, 1160 (TTAB 2019) (holding INVESTING IN 
AMERICAN JOBS not registrable for retail store services or promoting public awareness of goods 
made or assembled by American workers because the mark would be perceived merely as a commonly-
used informational message); In re Volvo Cars of N. Am., Inc., 46 USPQ2d 1455, 1460-61 (TTAB 
1998) (holding DRIVE SAFELY not registrable for automobiles and automobile parts because themark would be perceived merely as an “everyday, commonplace safety admonition”).
 
Terms and expressions that merely convey an informational message are not registrable. In re 
DePorter, 129 USPQ2d 1298, 1299 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Eagle Crest, Inc., 96 USPQ2d 1227, 
1229 (TTAB 2010)). Determining whether the term or expression functions as a trademark or service 
mark depends on how it would be perceived by the relevant public. Univ. of Ky. v. 40-0, LLC, 2021 
USPQ2d 253, at *25 (TTAB 2021) (citing In re Greenwood, 2020 USPQ2d 11439, at *2 (TTAB 
2020)); In re DePorter, 129 USPQ2d at 1303 (quoting In re Eagle Crest, Inc., 96 USPQ2d at 1229)); 
TMEP §1202.04. When there are no limitations on the goods or services in the application, the relevant 
public comprises all potential purchasers of the goods or services. In re Team Jesus LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 11489, at *3 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 265039, at *5 
(TTAB 2019)); see TMEP §1202.04. “The more commonly a term or expression is used, the less likely 
that the public will use it to identify only one source and the less likely that it will be recognized by 
purchasers as a trademark [or service mark].” In re Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *3 
(TTAB 2019) (citing In re Hulting, 107 USPQ2d 1175, 1177 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §1202.04(b).
 
The attached evidence from Merriam-Webster shows that this term or expression is commonly used to 
refer to vaccines or vaccination and conveys whether a person has been vaccinated.  Moreover, the 
attached 
evidence 
from Amazon, 
Teepublic, 
Vaxxed 
Designs, 
Zazzle, 
Etsy, 
Happy 
Tees, and Dilpop shows that the term VAXXED is commonly used on hats and shirts. Because 
consumers are accustomed to seeing this term or expression commonly used in everyday speech by 
many different sources, they would not perceive it as a mark identifying the source of applicant’s goods 
and/or services but rather as only conveying an informational message.
 
An applicant may not overcome this refusal by amending the application to seek registration on the 
Supplemental Register or asserting a claim of acquired distinctiveness under Section 2(f). In re Ocean 
Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *8; TMEP §1202.04(d); see In re TracFone Wireless, Inc., 2019 
USPQ2d 222983, at *4 (TTAB 2019). Nor will submitting a substitute specimen overcome this refusal. 
In re Team Jesus LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 11489, at *5-6 (TTAB 2020) (quoting D.C. One Wholesaler, Inc. 
v. Chien, 120 USPQ2d 1710, 1716 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1202.04(d).
 
Registration Refused- Failure to Function- Merely Informational
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is a slogan or term that does not function as a 
trademark or service mark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and/or services and to identify 
and distinguish them from others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, 3, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1053, 
1127. In this case, the applied-for mark is a slogan or term that would be perceived by consumers as 
merely conveying information about applicant’s or similar goods and/or services. See In re Bos. Beer 
Co., 198 F.3d 1370, 1372-74, 53 USPQ2d 1056, 1058-59 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (holding THE BEST BEER 
IN AMERICA for beer and ale not registrable because it is merely a common claim of superiority); In 
re TracFone Wireless, Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 222983, at *3 (TTAB 2019) (holding UNLIMITED 
CARRYOVER for telecommunications services not registrable because it “simply provides 
information about the services”); TMEP §1202.04(a).
 
Terms and expressions that merely convey an informational message, such as common statements or 
laudatory phrases about goods and/or services, are not registrable. In re DePorter, 129 USPQ2d 1298, 
1299 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Eagle Crest, Inc., 96 USPQ2d 1227, 1229 (TTAB 2010)). Determining 
whether the term or expression functions as a trademark or service mark depends on how it would be 
perceived by the relevant public. In re Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 129 USPQ2d 1148, 1150 (TTAB 2019)(citing D.C. One Wholesaler, Inc. v. Chien, 120 USPQ2d 1710, 1713 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1202.04. 
When there are no limitations on the goods or services in the application, the relevant public comprises 
all potential purchasers of the goods or services. In re Team Jesus LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 11489, at *3 
(TTAB 2020) (citing In re Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 265039, at *5 (TTAB 2019)); see 
TMEP §1202.04. “The more commonly a term or expression is used, the less likely that the public will 
use it to identify only one source and the less likely that it will be recognized by purchasers as a 
trademark [or service mark].” In re Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *3 (TTAB 2019) 
(citing In re Hulting, 107 USPQ2d 1175, 1177 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §1202.04(b).
 
The attached evidence from Amazon, Teepublic, Vaxxed Designs, Zazzle, Etsy, Happy Tees, and Dilpop 
shows that this term or expression is widely used in the marketplace to convey the wearer's vaccination 
status.  Thus, the wording is informational in that it conveys information about the wearer of the 
clothing items.  Because consumers are accustomed to seeing this slogan or term used in this manner, 
and would take the words at their ordinary meaning as applied to applicant’s goods and/or services, 
consumers are likely to perceive the wording merely as informational matter about the goods and/or 
services. Thus, this slogan or term would not be perceived as a mark that distinguishes applicant’s 
goods and/or services from those of others and identifies the source of applicant’s goods and/or 
services.
 
An applicant may not overcome this refusal by amending the application to seek registration on the 
Supplemental Register or asserting a claim of acquired distinctiveness under Section 2(f). In re Ocean 
Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *8; TMEP §1202.04(d); see In re TracFone Wireless, Inc., 2019 
USPQ2d 222983, at *4. Nor will submitting a substitute specimen overcome this refusal. In re Team 
Jesus LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 11489, at *5-6 (TTAB 2020) (quoting D.C. One Wholesaler, Inc. v. Chien, 
120 USPQ2d 1710, 1716 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1202.04(d).
 
 
Registration Refused- Mark is Merely Ornamental as Used on Specimen
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark as used on the specimen of record is merely a 
decorative or ornamental feature of applicant’s clothing and, thus, does not function as a trademark to 
indicate the source of applicant’s clothing and to identify and distinguish applicant’s clothing from 
others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1052, 1127; see In re Lululemon 
Athletica Can. Inc., 105 USPQ2d 1684, 1689 (TTAB 2013); In re Pro-Line Corp., 28 USPQ2d 1141, 
1142 (TTAB 1993); TMEP §§904.07(b), 1202.03 et seq.
 
The size, location, dominance, and significance of the alleged mark as used on the goods are all 
relevant factors in determining the commercial impression of the applied-for mark. See, e.g., In re 
Peace Love World Live, LLC, 127 USPQ2d 1400, 1403 (TTAB 2018) (quoting In re Hulting, 107 
USPQ2d 1175, 1178 (TTAB 2013)); In re Lululemon Athletica Can. Inc., 105 USPQ2d at 1687 
(quoting In re Right-On Co., 87 USPQ2d 1152, 1156 (TTAB 2008)); TMEP §1202.03(a).
 
With respect to clothing, consumers may recognize small designs or discrete wording as trademarks, 
rather than as merely ornamental features, when located, for example, on the pocket or breast area of a 
shirt. See TMEP §1202.03(a). Consumers may not, however, perceive larger designs or slogans as 
trademarks when such matter is prominently displayed across the front of a t-shirt. See In re Pro-Line 
Corp., 28 USPQ2d at 1142; In re Dimitri’s Inc., 9 USPQ2d 1666, 1667-68 (TTAB 1988); TMEP 
§1202.03(a), (b), (f)(i), (f)(ii).In this case, the submitted specimen shows the applied-for mark, VAXXED, located directly on the 
upper-center area of the front of the shirts and sweatshirt and the front portion of the hat, 
respectively, where ornamental elements often appear. See TMEP §1202.03(a), (b). Furthermore, the 
mark is displayed in a relatively large size on the clothing such that it dominates the overall appearance 
of the goods. Lastly, the applied-for mark appears to be a design element that is used in a merely 
decorative manner that would be perceived by consumers as having little or no particular source-
identifying significance.
 
Therefore, consumers would view the applied-for mark as a decorative or ornamental feature of the 
goods, rather than as a trademark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and to distinguish them 
from others.
 
In appropriate circumstances, applicant may overcome this refusal by satisfying one of the following 
options:
 
(1)       Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application (or prior to the 
filing of an amendment to allege use) and that shows proper trademark use for the 
identified goods in International Class 25. Examples of acceptable specimens that show 
non-ornamental use on clothing include hang tags and labels used inside a garment.
 
(2)       Amend to the Supplemental Register, which is a second trademark register 
for marks not yet eligible for registration on the Principal Register, but which may become 
capable over time of functioning as source indicators.
 
(3)       Claim acquired distinctiveness under Trademark Act Section 2(f) by 
submitting evidence that the applied-for mark has become distinctive of applicant’s goods; 
that is, proof that applicant’s extensive use and promotion of the mark allowed consumers 
now directly to associate the mark with applicant as the source of the goods.
 
(4)       Submit evidence that the applied-for mark is an indicator of secondary 
source; that is, proof that the mark is already recognized as a source indicator for other 
goods or services that applicant sells/offers.
 
(5)       Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b). This option will 
later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements.

webpage.

may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
