United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) 
Office Action (Official Letter) About Applicant’s Trademark Application
 
U.S. Application Serial No. 97120766
Mark:  TRUFFALO
Correspondence Address:  
JESSIE REIDER CRISTO 
BUCHALTER, APC 
1000 WILSHIRE BLVD., SUITE 1500LOS ANGELES CA 90017 UNITED STATES
Applicant:  Sauce Ventures LLC
Reference/Docket No. S1039-5016
Correspondence Email Address:  jreider@buchalter.com
 
 
NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 27, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting registered marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 
2(d). 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02. However, a mark in a prior-filed pending application may 
present a bar to registration of applicant’s mark.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Prior-filed application;
•
Specimen refusal;
•
Genericness refusal - Trademark Act Sections 23(c) and 45; and,
•
Information request 
•
 
 
A.    PRIOR-FILED APPLICATION
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 90122182 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s rightto address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
B.    SPECIMEN REFUSAL
 
Unattached tag or label does not include information about the goods. Registration is refused 
because the image of a tag or label submitted as a specimen in International Class 30 does not show the 
tag or label (1) attached to the goods or (2) including informational matter that typically appears on an 
actual tag or label for these types of goods as they are sold or transported in commerce and thus fails to 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (b)(1); Mandatory Electronic Filing & Specimen 
Requirements, Examination Guide 1-20, at V.A. (Rev. Feb. 2020); TMEP §§904.04(a), 904.07(a). An 
application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for 
mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a).  Here, applicant's mark appears as a single word on a rectangular label attached to 
nondescript shipping crates.  They are not affixed to the actual goods, or to the packaging that the 
goods are sold in, nor is there any indicia on the shipping crates as to what the content of the shipping 
crates are. 
 
Electronic specimens may be an image, such as a photograph or scanned copy, of the physical 
specimen. An image of a real tag or label attached to the goods generally meets the requirement for a 
specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce. 37 C.F.R. §2.56(a), (b)(1); 
TMEP §904.03(a). If not shown physically attached to the goods, an image of a tag or label may be 
accepted if, in addition to showing the mark, the tag or label bears indicia that it is an actual tag or label 
that is affixed to the goods as they are sold or transported in commerce. For example, the label 
“include[s] informational matter that typically appears on a label in use in commerce for those types of 
goods such as net weight, volume, UPC bar codes, lists of contents or ingredients, or other information 
that is not part of the mark but provides information about the goods.” Examination Guide 1-20, at 
V.A.
 
Examples of specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing the mark; (2) 
labels or tags shown attached to the goods or including informational matter that typically appears on a 
tag or label in use in commerce for these types of goods; (3) an actual container or packaging for the 
goods bearing the mark; or (4) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the 
goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a 
display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a picture or textual 
description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); 
see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c).  Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must 
include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the 
TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to the specimen refusal by satisfying one of the following 
for each applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verifiedsubstitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
C.    GENERICNESS REFUSAL
 
Registration is also refused on the Supplemental Register because the wording is generic and thus 
incapable of distinguishing applicant’s goods. Trademark Act Sections 23(c) and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1091(c), 1127; see TMEP §§1209.01(c) et seq.
 
A term is generic if its primary significance to the relevant public is the class or category of goods or 
services with which it is used. See USPTO v. Booking.com B.V., 140 S. Ct. 2298, 2304, 2020 USPQ2d 
10729, at *5 (2020); Princeton Vanguard, LLC v. Frito-Lay N. Am., Inc., 786 F.3d 960, 965, 114 
USPQ2d 1827, 1830 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int’l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc., 
782 F.2d 987, 989-90, 228 USPQ 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); TMEP §1209.01(c)(i). “[A] term [also] is 
generic if the relevant public understands the term to refer to part of the claimed genus of goods or 
services, even if the public does not understand the term to refer to the broad genus as a whole.” Royal 
Crown Co., Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 892 F.3d 1358, 1367-68, 127 USPQ2d 1041, 1046-47 (Fed. Cir. 
2018) (quoting In re Cordua Rests., Inc., 823 F.3d 594, 118 USPQ2d 1632, 1638 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (“the 
term ‘pizzeria’ would be generic for restaurant services, even though the public understands the term to 
refer to a particular sub-group or type of restaurant rather than to all restaurants”)).
 
Generic terms do not meet the statutory definition of a trademark because they are incapable of 
indicating a particular source of goods and thus cannot be registered. USPTO v. Booking.com B.V., 140 
S. Ct. at 2303, 2020 USPQ2d 10729, at *3-4; In re Cordua Rests., Inc., 823 F.3d at 599, 118 USPQ2d 
at 1634 (quoting In re Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, & Smith, Inc., 828 F.2d 1567, 1569, 4 USPQ2d 
1141, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (“Generic terms, by definition incapable of indicating source, are the 
antithesis of trademarks, and can never attain trademark status.”)); TMEP §1209.01(c).
 
The test for determining whether an applied-for mark is generic is its primary significance to the 
relevant public. See USPTO v. Booking.com B.V., 140 S. Ct. 2298, 2304, 2020 USPQ2d 10729, at *5 
(2020); Princeton Vanguard, LLC v. Frito-Lay N. Am., Inc., 786 F.3d 960, 965, 114 USPQ2d 1827, 
1830 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int’l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc., 782 F.2d 987, 
989-90, 228 USPQ 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); TMEP §1209.01(c)(i). Making this determination 
involves a two-step inquiry:
 
  (1)        What is the genus of goods at issue?(2)        Does the relevant public understand the designation primarily to refer to that genus of 
goods?
 
In re Cordua Rests., Inc., 823 F.3d 594, 599, 118 USPQ2d 1632, 1634 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing H. 
Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int’l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc., 782 F.2d at 990, 228 USPQ at 530; TMEP 
§1209.01(c)(i).
 
Regarding the first part of the inquiry, the genus of the goods may be defined by an applicant’s 
identification of goods. See In re Cordua Rests., Inc., 823 F.3d at 602, 118 USPQ2d at 1636 (quoting 
Magic Wand Inc. v. RDB Inc., 940 F.2d 638, 640, 19 USPQ2d 1551, 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1991)); see also In 
re 1800Mattress.com IP, LLC, 586 F.3d 1359, 1361, 1363, 92 USPQ2d 1682, 1682, 1684 (Fed. Cir. 
2009).
 
In this case, the application identifies the goods as"Sauces; Chicken wing sauce; Hot sauce," which 
adequately defines the genus at issue.
 
Regarding the second part of the inquiry, the relevant public is the purchasing or consuming public for 
the identified goods. Loglan Inst. Inc. v. Logical Language Grp., Inc., 962 F.2d 1038, 1041, 22 
USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (quoting Magic Wand Inc. v. RDB Inc., 940 F.2d at 640, 19 
USPQ2d at 1553). In this case, the relevant public comprises ordinary consumers, because there are no 
restrictions on the trade channels of the goods.
 
The attached evidence shows that the wording “TRUFFALO” refers to a spicy barbecue sauce featuring 
buffalo sauce and truffles, with buffalo sauce being a mixture of hot sauce and a fat, such as butter.  
(See: https://thecookful.com/buffalo-sauce-hot-sauce/).  The examining attorney attaches marketplace 
evidence showing widespread use of the term by others in reference to buffalo sauce containing 
truffles.  See, e.g.:
 
https://www.chewboom.com/2021/03/03/buffalo-wild-wings-launches-new-truffalo-sauce-made-

•
 
and thus the relevant public would understand this designation to refer primarily to that genus of 
goods being sauces that are a combination of buffalo sauce and truffles as the consuming public views 
this wording as a type of sauce.  
 
Websites and webpages are generally a competent source for determining how the public perceives the 
mark in connection with applicant’s goods. See In re N.C. Lottery, 866 F.3d 1363, 1367-68, 123 
USPQ2d 1707, 1709-10 (Fed. Cir. 2017); In re Nett Designs, Inc., 236 F.3d 1339, 1341, 57 USPQ2d 
1564, 1566 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing In re Bed & Breakfast Registry, 791 F.2d 157, 160, 229 USPQ 818, 
819 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); TMEP §1209.01(b).
 
As the wording "TRUFFALO" comprises a genus of hot sauce and/or a sub-genus of "sauces," 
registration is refused on the Supplemental Register under Sections 23(c) and 45 of the Trademark Act.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
D.    INFORMATION REQUEST
 
Due to the generic nature of the applied-for mark, applicant must provide the following information and 
documentation regarding the goods and wording appearing in the mark:
 
(1)        Fact sheets, instruction manuals, brochures, advertisements and pertinent 
screenshots of applicant’s website as it relates to the goods in the application, including 
any materials using the terms in the applied-for mark. Merely stating that information 
about the goods is available on applicant’s website is insufficient to make the information 
of record.;
 
(2)        If these materials are unavailable, applicant should submit similar 
documentation for goods of the same type, explaining how its own product or services will 
differ. If the goods feature new technology and information regarding competing goods is 
not available, applicant must provide a detailed factual description of the goods. Factual 
information about the goods must make clear how they operate, salient features, and 
prospective customers and channels of trade.  Conclusory statements will not satisfy this 
requirement.; and(3)        Applicant must respond to the following questions:
 
Are the goods primarily comprised of buffalo sauce and truffles and/or truffle 
oil/extracts?
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§814, 1402.01(e).
 
If applicant submits webpage evidence to satisfy this requirement, applicant must provide (1) an image 
of the webpage, (2) the date it was accessed or printed, and (3) the complete URL address. In re ADCO 
Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 
1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018)); TMEP §710.01(b). Providing only a website address or hyperlink to the 
webpage is not sufficient to make the materials of record. In re ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 
USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (citing In re Olin Corp., 124 USPQ2d 1327, 1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB 
Solomon Assocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); TBMP §1208.03); TMEP §814.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 27, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120766
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
