The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive
•
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature, ingredient, 
characteristic, purpose, function, intended audience of applicant’s goods and/or services.  Trademark 
Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s goods 
and/or services, not in the abstract. DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 
675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b). “Whether 
consumers could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the 
test.” In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).
 
The wording "CRAYONS" is contained in the identification of goods. The attached Internet evidence 
from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary establishes that the wording "CREATIVE" means "marked by 
the ability or power to create : given to creating", "CRAYONS" means "a stick of white or colored 
chalk or of colored wax used for writing or drawing" and "WORKSHOP" means "a small establishment 
where manufacturing or handicrafts are carried on". 
 
Applicant’s goods are crayons, posters of paper, and coloring books. Therefore, the proposed mark 
merely describes a characteristic of applicant’s goods, namely, that they include crayons, given to 
creating, and manufactured in a small establishment devoted to creation and crayons.
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not registrable. In re 
Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re Tower Tech, Inc., 64 
USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., In re Cannon Safe, Inc., 116 
USPQ2d 1348, 1351 (TTAB 2015) (holding SMART SERIES merely descriptive of metal gun safes); 
In re King Koil Licensing Co., 79 USPQ2d 1048, 1052 (TTAB 2006) (holding THE BREATHABLE 
MATTRESS merely descriptive of beds, mattresses, box springs, and pillows).Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not registrable. In re 
Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re Tower Tech, Inc., 64 
USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. 
Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding 
SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as hypodermic, 
aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 (TTAB 
2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner that is an 
integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods is the combined mark registrable. See In re 
Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 
549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In 
re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
goods and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods. 
Specifically, the individual meanings of the words in the mark do not change when they are used in 
combination in connection with applicant's goods.
 
Conclusion
 
Because applicant’s proposed mark is descriptive of applicant’s goods, registration is refused under 
Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. 
 
Advisory: Supplemental Register
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register. Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816. Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant 
from submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal(s). TMEP §816.04.
 
Applicant is advised that, if the application is amended to seek registration on the Supplemental 
Register, applicant will be required to disclaim “CRAYONS WORKSHOP” because such wording 
appears to be generic in the context of applicant’s goods. See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Wella Corp., 
565 F.2d 143, 144, 196 USPQ 7, 8 (C.C.P.A. 1977); In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 
USPQ 766, 768 (TTAB 1986); TMEP §1213.03(b).
 
Applicant may submit a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “CRAYONS WORKSHOP” apart from the 
mark as shown.TMEP §1213.08(a)(i).
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
