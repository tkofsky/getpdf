NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
Introduction
 
This Office action is supplemental to and supersedes the previous Office action issued on August 23, 
2022 in connection with this application. The assigned trademark examining attorney inadvertently 
omitted a requirement relevant to the mark in the subject application. See TMEP §§706, 711.02.Specifically, as detailed below, applicant's entity type is uncertain and must be clarified.
 
The trademark examining attorney apologizes for any inconvenience caused by the delay in raising this 
issue.
 
Applicant must address all issues raised in this Office action, in addition to the issues raised in the 
earlier Office action dated August 23, 2022. The issues raised in the previous August 23, 2022 Office 
action are as follows and are maintained: specimen refusal, requirement for disclaimer of descriptive 
wording, and requirement for information regarding mark significance.
 
The following is a SUMMARY OF ISSUES that applicant must address:
 
NEW ISSUE: Applicant Must Clarify Entity Type 
•
Specimen is Merely a Drawing or Depiction of the Mark Refusal
•
Disclaimer of Descriptive Wording Required
•
Information regarding Mark Significance Required 
•
 
Applicant must respond to all issues raised in this Office action and the previous August 23, 2022 
Office action, within six (6) months of the date of issuance of this Office action. 37 C.F.R. §2.62(a); see 
TMEP §711.02. If applicant does not respond within this time limit, the application will be abandoned. 
37 C.F.R. §2.65(a). 
 
NEW ISSUE: Applicant Must Clarify Entity Type
 
The name of an individual person appears in the section of the application intended for the trademark 
owner’s name; however, the legal entity is set forth as a limited liability company. Applicant must 
clarify this inconsistency. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), (a)(3)(i)-(ii), 2.61(b); TMEP §803.02(a).
 
If applicant is an individual, applicant should simply request that the legal entity be amended to 
“individual” and must indicate his/her country of citizenship for the record. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(i); 
TMEP §803.03(a). Alternatively, if applicant is a limited liability company, applicant must provide the 
correct name of the limited liability company and the U.S. state or foreign country of incorporation or 
organization. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §803.03(h).
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration may be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).
 
Specimen is Merely a Drawing or Depiction of the Mark Refusal
 
Registration is refused because the specimen is merely a photocopy of the drawing or a depiction of the 
applied-for mark and does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the 
services in International Class 35. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 
C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (c); In re Chica, 84 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (TTAB 2007); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods and/or 
services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R.§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the 
filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for 
the goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement 
made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The 
substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in 
commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the 
amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this 
statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Response Options to Refusals 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below and above.
 
Disclaimer of Descriptive Wording Required 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “TEQUILA” because it is merely descriptive of a feature of 
applicant’s services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, 
Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
As shown by the attached evidence from applicant's website, applicant is a "family owned Tequila and 
Mezcal Distributor based in Texas." Therefore, the wording TEQUILA is merely descriptive of thepurpose of applicant's distributorship services, that is, to distribute TEQUILA to consumers.  
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “TEQUILA” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
Information regarding Mark Significance Required  
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must clarify whether wording in the mark 
has any particular significance, as follows:
 
(1) Industry significance. Explain whether the term “181” in the mark has any meaning or 
significance in the trade or industry in which applicant’s goods and/or services are 
manufactured or provided, any meaning or significance as applied to applicant’s goods and/or 
services, or if such wording is a term of art within applicant’s industry. Specifically, applicant 
must explain whether the term "181" has any meaning or significance as it relates to tequila 
and/or alcohol distributorship services
 
(2) Geographical significance. Explain whether the term “181” in the mark identifies or refers 
to a geographic place.
 
(3) Other significance. Respond to the following questions:
 
          What does the term "181" mean, represent, and/or signify?
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §814. If the wording has no significance and is not a term of art in the 
relevant trade or industry or as used with applicant’s goods and/or services, and does not have any 
geographical or other significance, applicant must provide a statement to that effect. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.61(b); TMEP §814.
 
To respond to the above requirement for information, open the appropriate Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and enter the serial number, answer “yes” to question 3, and 
on the “Additional Statement(s)” page in either the “Significance of Wording, Letter(s), or Numeral(s)” 
text box(es) and/or the “Miscellaneous Statement” text box(es), enter the information and/or explain 
documentation being submitted with such information and attach it by clicking the button below the 
text box.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
Response GuidelinesFor this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal and/or requirement in this 
Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and evidence against the refusal,

Advisory regarding Hiring Trademark Attorney
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for

number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.

Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Specimen is Merely a Drawing or Depiction of the Mark Refusal
 
Registration is refused because the specimen is merely a photocopy of the drawing or a depiction of the 
applied-for mark and does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the 
services in International Class 35. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 
C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (c); In re Chica, 84 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (TTAB 2007); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods and/or 
services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the 
filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for 
the goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement 
made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The 
substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in 
commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the 
amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this 
statement.(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Disclaimer of Descriptive Wording Required 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “TEQUILA” because it is merely descriptive of a feature of 
applicant’s services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, 
Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
As shown by the attached evidence from applicant's website, applicant is a "family owned Tequila and 
Mezcal Distributor based in Texas." Therefore, the wording TEQUILA is merely descriptive of the 
purpose of applicant's distributorship services, that is, to distribute TEQUILA to consumers.

may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
