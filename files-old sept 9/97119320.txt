NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
 
Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues
 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusal
•
 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusal 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 4505230. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) therelatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark LILINUS in standard characters for “Earphones; 
Mousepads; Cases for mobile phones; Cell phone battery chargers for use in vehicles; Cell phone cases; 
In-car telephone handset cradles; Lighting control panels; Loud speakers; Plug adaptors; Power cables; 
Power wires; Protective covers and cases for cell phones, laptops and portable media players; 
Waterproof cases for smart phones; Wireless chargers; Computer storage devices, namely, blank flash 
drives” in International Class 9.
 
Registrant’s mark is LILIN with a design for “Cameras; digital video recorders; camera housings; 
camera brackets; internet protocol cameras; circumrotate platforms for use in cameras; [ video 
monitors; ] surveillance cameras; [ matrix switchers; scanner; ] outdoor pan, namely, a rotational 
camera drive for rotationally activating a camera in a tilt rotation about a horizontal axis and a scan 
rotation about a vertical axis” in International Class 9. 
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Here, applicant’s mark, LILINUS, is confusingly similar to the registered mark, LILIN. 
 
The two marks are identical except for the addition of the wording "US" at the end of the applied-for 
mark. Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any 
trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 
1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between 
VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a 
‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 
Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) 
(finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because 
“consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial 
words is particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”).  
 
In this case, consumers will focus on the first part of the applied-for mark, which is identical to the 
entirety of the registered mark. 
 
While the registered mark has a design component, when evaluating a composite mark consisting ofwords and a design, the word portion is normally accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a 
greater impression upon purchasers, be remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request 
the goods and/or services. In re Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) 
(citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP 
§1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks must be compared in their entireties, the word portion is often 
considered the dominant feature and is accorded greater weight in determining whether marks are 
confusingly similar, even where the word portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 
1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 
1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).
 
Because the dominant textual portion of the registered mark is so visually similar to the applied-for 
mark, the marks create an overall similar commercial impression. 
 
Therefore, because the marks look similar and create the same commercial impression, the marks are 
considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes. 
 
Relatedness of the Goods  
 
The goods are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods and/or services] 
emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Here, applicant’s goods, “Earphones; Mousepads; Cases for mobile phones; Cell phone battery 
chargers for use in vehicles; Cell phone cases; In-car telephone handset cradles; Lighting control 
panels; Loud speakers; Plug adaptors; Power cables; Power wires; Protective covers and cases for cell 
phones, laptops and portable media players; Waterproof cases for smart phones; Wireless chargers; 
Computer storage devices, namely, blank flash drives,” are closely related to registrant’s goods, 
“Cameras; digital video recorders; camera housings; camera brackets; internet protocol cameras; 
circumrotate platforms for use in cameras; [ video monitors; ] surveillance cameras; [ matrix switchers; 
scanner; ] outdoor pan, namely, a rotational camera drive for rotationally activating a camera in a tilt 
rotation about a horizontal axis and a scan rotation about a vertical axis.” 
 
The attached Internet evidence, from B&H Photo Video, Best Buy, and Crutchfield, establishes that the 
relevant goods are sold or provided through the same trade channels and used by the same classes of 
consumers in the same fields of use. Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are considered related for 
likelihood of confusion purposes. See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 
(TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009). 
 
Different goods in the electrical, electronic, and/or electromechanical fields have been found to berelated where the evidence shows that the goods would be marketed through the same channels of trade 
and/or sold to the same classes of purchasers. See, e.g., Alliance Mfg. Co. v. ABH Diversified Prods., 
Inc., 226 USPQ 348 (TTAB 1985) (finding cycling-type furnace controllers and various home 
products, including garage door openers and remote controls for operating lights and appliances, to be 
related, where both parties’ goods were electrically powered/electronically operated, had similar energy 
conserving characteristics, and were sold for residential use); In re Globe-Union Inc., 189 USPQ 158, 
159 (TTAB 1975) (finding resistor-capacitor components and ceramic condensers to be related, where 
such goods “would be sold in the same trade channels to the same classes of purchasers such as original 
equipment manufacture[r]s for incorporation in the same piece of electronic equipment or apparatus”); 
In re Dynaco, Inc., 189 USPQ 104, 105 (TTAB 1975) (finding two-channel stereophonic amplifiers, 
loudspeakers, and non-electronic devices for connecting amplifiers and speakers, on the one hand, and 
switching transistors, on the other, to be related because the goods would be “invariably sold to the 
same class of purchasers in such circumstances and conditions that if persons were to encounter them 
under the same or similar marks, they might well be induced to believe that they originate from a 
common source”); Nat'l Steel Constr. Co. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 158 USPQ 464 (TTAB 1968) 
(finding electric washing machines and electric water heaters to be related, where such goods were sold 
through the same channels of trade to the same class of purchaser, where the purchase of one of the 
party’s goods could lead to the purchase of the other party’s goods, and where the evidence of record 
indicated that a single manufacturer might produce both electric washing machines and electric water 
heaters).  
 
Accordingly, the goods are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of confusion analysis. 
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods are related, there is a likelihood of confusion as to the 
source of applicant’s goods, and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.
