Office Action (Official Letter) About Applicant’s Trademark Application
 
U.S. Application Serial No. 97120826
Mark:  HOROLOGY HOUR
Correspondence Address:  
CORSMEIER, COLLIN M. 
610 16TH STREET 
HUNTINGTON BEACH CA 92648 UNITED STATES
Applicant:  Corsmeier, Collin M.
Reference/Docket No. N/A

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKSThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Disclaimer Required
•
Clarification of Legal Entity Required
•
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “HOROLOGY” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary shows this wording means "the art of 
making instruments for indicating time".  Thus, the wording merely describes applicant’s goods and/or 
services because they are for services relating to or featuring time-indicating instruments, 
or horological instruments.
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove the 
disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “HOROLOGY” apart from the mark as 
shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire mark. 
See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1041, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005); TMEP 
§1213.01(b).
 
CLARIFICATION OF LEGAL ENTITY REQUIRED
 
The name of an individual person appears in the section of the application intended for the trademark 
owner’s name, and the legal entity of the owner is listed as "INDIVIDUAL"; however, a DBA/AKA 
entity is set forth as a limited liability company. Applicant must clarify this inconsistency. See 37 
C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), (a)(3)(i)-(ii), 2.61(b); TMEP §803.02(a).
 
If applicant is an individual, applicant should note that the legal entity be maintained as “individual” 
along with the indication of his/her country of citizenship for the record. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(i);TMEP §803.03(a). Alternatively, if applicant is a limited liability company, applicant must provide the 
correct name of the limited liability company, amend its entity type, and indicate the U.S. state or 
foreign country of incorporation or organization. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §803.03(h).
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration may be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).
 
ADVISORY: APPLICANT MAY WANT TO SEEK TRADEMARK COUNSEL
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for 
more information.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120826
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
