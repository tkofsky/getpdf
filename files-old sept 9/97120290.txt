NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a characteristic of applicant’s 
services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et 
seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services.  TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl& Larson 
LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 
1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of 
Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)). 
 
Determining the descriptiveness of a mark is done in relation to an applicant’s goods and/or services, 
the context in which the mark is being used, and the possible significance the mark would have to the 
average purchaser because of the manner of its use or intended use.  See In re The Chamber of 
Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing In re 
Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d 960, 963-64, 82 USPQ2d 1828, 1831 (Fed. Cir. 2007)); TMEP 
§1209.01(b).  Descriptiveness of a mark is not considered in the abstract.  In re Bayer 
Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d at 963-64, 82 USPQ2d at 1831.
 
In the instant case, applicant seeks registration of ITELECENTER for “SaaS Telecommunication 
services, cloud phone systems with features such as dedicated phone numbers, call forwarding, SIP 
calling, voicemail, employee extensions, call transcription, IVR, SMS/Texting, call monitoring and 
recording, call analytics, etc.” 
 
According to the attached evidence, the letter “i” or “I” used as a prefix would be understood by the 
purchasing public to refer to the Internet when used in relation to Internet-related products or services.
 
When a mark consists of this prefix coupled with a descriptive word or term for Internet-related 
services, then the entire mark may be considered merely descriptive. See RxD Media, LLC v. IP 
Application Dev. LLC, 125 USPQ2d 1801, 1810-14 (TTAB 2018) (holding IPAD merely descriptive of 
web-based software for mobile-access database management in which users can store and access their 
personal information); In re Zanova, Inc., 59 USPQ2d 1300, 1304 (TTAB 2000) (holding ITOOL 
merely descriptive of computer software for use in creating web pages, and custom designing websites 
for others); TMEP §1209.03(d).
 
The term TELE is defined as “By telephone, on the telephone” (see attached). The term CENTER is 
defined as “A place where a particular activity or service is concentrated” (see attached). Applicant is 
providing a CENTER or website for INTERNET TELEPHONE services (see specimen of record). 
Accordingly, the wording merely describes the services and where the services are rendered.Accordingly, registration on the Principal Register must be refused under Trademark Act Section 
2(e)(1).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. If applicant responds to the refusal(s), 
applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
Identification and Classification of Services
 
The identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified to further specify the nature of the 
services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must amend the identification to 
specify the common commercial or generic name of the services. See TMEP §1402.01. If the services 
have no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe or explain the nature of the 
services using clear and succinct language. See id. 
 
Applicant has classified “SaaS telecommunication services” in International Class 038; however, the 
proper classification is International Class 042. Therefore, applicant may respond by (1) adding 
International Class 042 to the application and reclassifying these services in the proper international 
class, (2) deleting “SaaS telecommunication services” from the application, or (3) deleting the 
remainder of the items in the identification and reclassifying the specified services in the proper 
international class. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.86(a), 6.1; TMEP §§1403.02 et seq. If applicant adds one or 
more international classes to the application, applicant must comply with the multiple-class 
requirements specified in this Office action.  
 
The wording “etc” in the identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because it fails to 
identify specific services. See TMEP §1402.03(a). Therefore, applicant must delete this indefinite 
wording from the identification and specify the common commercial or generic name for these 
services.
 
In an identification, an applicant must use the common commercial or generic name for the services, be 
specific and all-inclusive, and avoid using indefinite words or phrases. TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03(a). 
Further, applicant may amend the identification to list only those items that are within the scope of the 
services set forth in the initial application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. Scope is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of the wording in 
the identification. TMEP §1402.07(a).
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 038: TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES, NAMELY, PROVIDING ADVANCED cloud 
phone CALLING FEATURES, NAMELY, CALL FORWARDING TO dedicated phone numbers, call 
forwarding, SESSION INITIATION PROTOCOL calling, voicemail, TRANSFERING CALLS TO 
employee 
extensions, 
call 
transcription, 
INTERACTIVE 
VOICE 
RESPONSE, 
SMS/Text 
MESSAGING SERVICES, call monitoring and recording, call analytics IN THE NATURE OF ___ 
(SPECIFY CLASS 038 NATURE), AND ____ (SPECIFY OTHER CLASS 038 CLOUD PHONE 
SERVICES)
 
Class 042: TELECOMMUNICATION SOFTWARE AS A SERVICES (SaaS) SERVICES 
FEATURING SOFTWARE FOR ____ (SPECIFY FUNCTION, e.g., ENABLING CALL 
FORWARDING, SESSION INITIATION PROTOCOL CALLING, VOICEMAIL, EMPLOYEEEXTENSIONS, CALL TRANSCRIPTION INTERACTIVE VOICE RESPONSE, SMS/TEXT 
MESSAGING SERVICES, CALL MONITORING AND RECORDING, CALL ANALYTICS)
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Requirements for Combined Applications – 1(a) 
 
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) 
already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 2 
classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 class. Applicant must 
either (a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) 
restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for class(es) 038; and applicant needs a specimen for class(es) 042. See more 
information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between 
the mark and the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) 
a photograph of business signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the 
sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP 
§1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’sURL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce 
on or in connection with the services listed in the application at least as early as the 
filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
