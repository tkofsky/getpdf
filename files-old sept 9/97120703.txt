NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:  
 
Refusal under Trademark Act Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion 
1. 
Refusal under Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1) – Mark is Merely Descriptive
2. 
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 3933061. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Applicant's mark is THE BEST PRACTICE (standard characters) for “Providing on-line continuing 
professional education seminars, workshops and classroom instruction in the healthcare and nursing 
fields” in International Class 041. 
 
Registrant's mark is BEST PRACTICES ACADEMY (standard characters) for “Continuing education 
services, namely, providing live and on-line continuing professional education seminars in the field of 
chiropractic” in International Class 041.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-
by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 
1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those 
factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in 
every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) 
(quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared  services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 
1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 
1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 
USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the 
cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Analysis of the Marks 
Applicant’s mark, THE BEST PRACTICE, is confusingly similar to the registered mark, BEST 
PRACTICES ACADEMY, in meaning or connotation and overall commercial impression because both 
marks feature the nearly identical wording BEST PRACTICE(S). 
 
Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or 
dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 
USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 
751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or 
generic for a party’s goods and/or services (such as ACADEMY in registrant’s mark) is typically less 
significant or less dominant when comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 
128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 
USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). 
 
In this case, the marks share the inearly identical wording BEST PRACTICE(S) which is the dominant 
wording in each mark. Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases 
or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall 
commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 
689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, 
Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and 
COMMUNICASH confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) 
(holding CONFIRM and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 
USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
When comparing similar marks, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has found that inclusion of the 
term “the” at the beginning of one of the marks will generally not affect or otherwise diminish the 
overall similarity between the marks. See In re Thor Tech Inc., 90 USPQ2d 1634, 1635 (TTAB 2009) 
(finding WAVE and THE WAVE “virtually identical” marks; “[t]he addition of the word ‘The’ at the 
beginning of the registered mark does not have any trademark significance.”); In re Narwood Prods. 
Inc., 223 USPQ 1034, 1034 (TTAB 1984) (finding THE MUSIC MAKERS and MUSIC-MAKERS 
“virtually identical” marks; the inclusion of the definite article “the” is “insignificant in determining 
likelihood of confusion”). Thus, the THE in applicant's mark is irrelevant.
 
Applicant has deleted the generic wording ACADEMY in registrant’s mark. Although applicant’s markdoes not contain the entirety of the registered mark, applicant’s mark is likely to appear to prospective 
purchasers as a shortened form of registrant’s mark. See In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 
94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting United States Shoe Corp., 229 USPQ 707, 709 
(TTAB 1985)). Thus, merely omitting some of the wording from a registered mark may not overcome a 
likelihood of confusion. See In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 94 USPQ2d 1257; In re Optica 
Int’l, 196 USPQ 775, 778 (TTAB 1977); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii). In this case, applicant’s mark 
does not create a distinct commercial impression from the registered mark because it contains some of 
the wording in the registered mark and does not add any wording that would distinguish it from that 
mark.
 
An applied-for mark that is the singular or plural form of a registered mark is essentially identical in 
sound, appearance, meaning, and commercial impression, and thus the marks are confusingly similar. 
Swiss Grill Ltd., v. Wolf Steel Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 2001, 2011 n.17 (TTAB 2015) (holding “it is obvious 
that the virtually identical marks [the singular and plural of SWISS GRILL] are confusingly similar”); 
Weider Publ’ns, LLC v. D & D Beauty Care Co., 109 USPQ2d 1347, 1355 (TTAB 2014) (finding the 
singular and plural forms of SHAPE to be essentially the same mark) (citing Wilson v. Delaunay, 245 
F.2d 877, 878, 114 USPQ 339, 341 (C.C.P.A. 1957) (finding no material difference between the 
singular and plural forms of ZOMBIE such that the marks were considered the same mark). Because 
THE and ACADEMY are non-sourced identifying wording, both marks are, in essence, BEST 
PRACTICES and BEST PRACTICE and thus are essentially identical. 
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.” 
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b). The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks. In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 
(TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP 
§1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 
2014).  Here, the average user encountering these marks would likely assume a connection between 
applicant and registrant because the marks convey the same commercial impression. 
 
Although there are some slight differences between the marks, applicant’s mark in its entirety conveys 
the same connotation and overall commercial impression as registrant’s mark. In other words, the THE 
in applicant’s mark and the ACADEMY in registrant’s mark does not alter the meaning of the mark as 
it is applied to educational services.  A consumer encountering the mark THE BEST PRACTICE in 
connection with applicant’s services will incorrectly believe that the services originate from the same 
source as registrant’s BEST PRACTICES ACADEMY services.
 
Analysis of the Services 
The compared services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods and/or services] 
emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
To the extent that both of the parties provide health-related educational services, the services are 
closely related if not identical. 
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the services stated in the application 
and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 
1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).
 
In this case, the application uses broad wording to describe its "continuing professional education 
seminars, workshops and classroom instruction in the healthcare and nursing fields" which presumably 
encompasses all services of the type described, including registrant's more narrow "continuing 
education services, namely, providing live and on-line continuing professional education seminars in 
the field of chiropractic". See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 
2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015). Thus, applicant’s 
and registrant’s services are legally identical. See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 
1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 
209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 
(TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.” In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of third party websites from Continuing Education, Inc., 
Logan University, and AchieveCE offering healthcare and nursing education (identified by applicant) 
and chiropractic education (identified by registrant), establishes that the same entity commonly 
provides the relevant services and markets them under the same mark, the relevant services are 
provided through the same trade channels and used by the same classes of consumers in the same fields 
of use, and the services are similar or complementary in terms of purpose or function, namely, 
continuing education in the field of health. Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are considered 
related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 
1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 
2009).
 
The trademark examining attorney has attached evidence from the USPTO’s X-Search database 
consisting of a number of third-party marks registered for use in connection with the same or similar 
services as those of both applicant and registrant in this case. This evidence shows that the services 
listed therein, namely, healthcare or nursing education (identified by applicant) and chiropractic 
education (identified by registrant), are of a kind that may emanate from a single source under a single 
mark. See In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 1730, 1737 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Infinity Broad. Corp., 
60 USPQ2d 1214, 1217-18 (TTAB 2001); In re Albert Trostel & Sons Co., 29 USPQ2d 1783, 1785-86 
(TTAB 1993); In re Mucky Duck Mustard Co., 6 USPQ2d 1467, 1470 n.6 (TTAB 1988)); TMEP

Summary of Analysis
A consumer encountering the mark THE BEST PRACTICE in connection with applicant’s healthcare 
and nursing education services will incorrectly believe that the services originate from the same source 
as registrant’s BEST PRACTICES ACADEMY chiropractic educationservices.  As a result, because of 
the confusingly similar marks and closely related and potentially identical services, registration is 
refused under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark THE BEST PRACTICE merely describes a 
feature, purpose, or subject matter of applicant’s services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, Inc., 783 
F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 
373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 
1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. 
Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
Determining the descriptiveness of a mark is done in relation to an applicant’s ervices, the context in 
which the mark is being used, and the possible significance the mark would have to the average 
purchaser because of the manner of its use or intended use. See In re The Chamber of Commerce of the 
U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing In re Bayer 
Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d 960, 963-64, 82 USPQ2d 1828, 1831 (Fed. Cir. 2007)); TMEP 
§1209.01(b). Descriptiveness of a mark is not considered in the abstract. In re Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 
488 F.3d at 963-64, 82 USPQ2d at 1831.
 
In this case, applicant has applied for the mark THE BEST PRACTICE in connection with "on-line 
continuing professional education seminars, workshops and classroom instruction in the healthcare and 
nursing fields."
 
Adding the term “the” to a descriptive or generic term generally does not add any source-indicating 
significance or otherwise affect the term’s descriptiveness or genericness. See, e.g., In re Consumer 
Prot. Firm PLLC, 2021 USPQ2d 238, at *18 (TTAB 2021) (holding THE CONSUMER 
PROTECTION FIRM generic for legal services; adding the definite article “the” did not affect the 
term’s genericness); In re Place Inc., 76 USPQ2d 1467, 1468 (TTAB 2005) (holding THE GREATEST 
BAR merely descriptive of restaurant and bar services; “the definite article THE . . . add[s] no source-
indicating significance to the mark as a whole”); Conde Nast Publ’ns Inc. v. Redbook Publ’g Co., 217 
USPQ 356, 357, 360 (TTAB 1983) (holding THE MAGAZINE FOR YOUNG WOMEN a “commondescriptive or ‘generic’ name of a class or type of magazine” and incapable of indicating source; “[t]he 
fact that the slogan also includes the article ‘The’ is insignificant. This word cannot serve as an 
indication of origin, even if applicant’s magazine were the only magazine for young women.”).
 
As the dictionary definitions attached indicate, BEST means “Surpassing all others in excellence, 
achievement, or quality; most excellent” while PRACTICE means “To carry out in action” or "The act 
or process of doing something; performance or action". The combination of terms BEST PRACTICE 
means: 
 
a procedure that has been shown by research and experience to produce optimal results and that 
is established or proposed as a standard suitable for widespread adoption 
•
Commercial or professional procedures that are accepted or prescribed as being correct or most 
effective. 
•
Best practice is the way of running a business or providing a service that is recognized as correct 
or most effective. 
•
the best, most effective way to do something 
•
a working method or set of working methods that is officially accepted as being the best to use in 
a particular business or industry, usually described formally and in detail 
•
 
See dictionary definitions attached. As such, the mark immediately informs consumers that applicant’s 
educational services are in the field of best practices or excellent means of carrying out actions in the 
field of healthcare or nursing.  As the Internet evidence attached confirms, BEST PRACTICE is used in 
a descriptive manner by third parties offering or discussing the same type of services as applicant: 
 
As online nursing education programs continue to increase to meet the demands of the growing 
market, nursing faculty are challenged to develop and deliver courses based on best practice 
principles. 
•
This course focuses on nursing knowledge synthesis and application of research evidence into 
best practice. 
•
The framework provides a graphic illustration of the key principles of professional school 
nursing practice, reflecting the organization's stance for evidence-based best practice and 
providing focus to priority school nursing activities.  
•
 
As shown in the above, the wording in applicant’s mark is commonly used by a number of third-parties 
in the relevant field in a descriptive manner to refer to educational services that are in the field of 
healthcare best practices. As applied to applicant’s services, consumers would readily understand that 
the wording BEST PRACTICE merely refers to the nature or subject of the services.
 
Third-party registrations featuring services the same as or similar to applicant’s services are probative 
evidence on the issue of descriptiveness where the relevant word or term is disclaimed, registered under 
Trademark Act Section 2(f) based on acquired distinctiveness, or registered on the Supplemental 
Register. E.g., In re Morinaga Nyugyo Kabushiki Kaisha, 120 USPQ2d 1738, 1745 (TTAB 2016) 
(quoting Inst. Nat’l des Appellations D’Origine v. Vintners Int’l Co., 958 F.2d 1574, 1581-82, 22 
USPQ2d 1190, 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1992)); In re Box Solutions Corp., 79 USPQ2d 1953, 1955 (TTAB 
2006). See attached registrations in which the same/similar wording was found to be descriptive when 
used in connection with related services.
 
CONCLUSIONBecause the mark immediately describes a feature of applicant’s services, namely, that the services are 
educational services are in the field of best practices, registration is refused under Section 2(e)(1). 
 
ADVISORY
 
In addition to being merely descriptive, the applied-for mark appears to be generic in connection with 
the identified services. “A generic mark, being the ‘ultimate in descriptiveness,’ cannot acquire 
distinctiveness” and thus is not entitled to registration on either the Principal or Supplemental Register 
under any circumstances. In re La. Fish Fry Prods., Ltd., 797 F.3d 1332, 1336, 116 USPQ2d 1262,

Stacey C. Friends, Esq.United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120703
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
