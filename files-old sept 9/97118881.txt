Mark:  BEEKEEPER MADE

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 28, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marksand has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below to enable further prosecution of the 
application. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Disclaimer
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “BEEKEEPER MADE” because it is merely descriptive of an 
ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or 
services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The examining attorney relies on evidence in the form of the attached dictionary definition and/or web 
evidence. The evidence shows the wording BEEKEEPER means or refers to those who operate apiaries 
and MADE is the nature of the goods which can be produced from the bee products. In relation to the 
identified goods, the wording is merely descriptive because it designates a feature, quality or 
characteristic of the goods. Specifically, the identified goods are sufficiently broad to include or 
encompass or feature goods which are made by beekeepers. Thus, consumers who encounter the 
wording in relation to the goods would immediately understand that the wording refers to a salient 
aspect. The wording therefore must be disclaimed 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “BEEKEEPER MADE” apart from the mark 
as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
Response guidelines
 
Applicant should include the following information on all correspondence with the Office: (1) the name 
and law office number of the trademark examining attorney, (2) the serial number and filing date of the 
application, (3) the date of issuance of this Office action, (4) applicant's name, address, telephone 
number and e-mail address (if applicable), and (5) the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.194(b)(1); TMEP §302.03(a). 
 
If applicant does not respond to this Office action within six months of the issue/mailing date, or 
responds by expressly abandoning the application, the application process will end and the trademark 
will fail to register. See 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.65(a), 2.68(a); TMEP §§718.01, 718.02. 
Additionally, the USPTO will not refund the application filing fee, which is a required processing 
fee. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(1)(i)-(iv), 2.209(a); TMEP §405.04.
 
When an application has abandoned for failure to respond to an Office action, an applicant may timely 
file a petition to revive the application, which, if granted, would allow the application to return to active 
status. See 37 C.F.R. §2.66; TMEP §1714. The petition must be filed within two months of the date of 
issuance of the notice of abandonment and may be filed online via the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) with a $100 fee. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(15)(ii), 2.66(a)(1), (b)(1).How to respond.  Click to file a response to this nonfinal Office action.

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
