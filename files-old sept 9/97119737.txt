Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.

§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.

SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Specimen Refusal, as to class 016 ONLY
•
Amended Identification of Services Required, as to class 041 ONLY
•
Disclaimer Required
•
 
 
SPECIMEN REFUSAL
 
Applies to class 016 ONLY
 
Specimen is not an acceptable webpage display. Registration is refused because the specimen in 
International Class 016 is not acceptable as a display associated with the goods and does not show the 
applied-for mark as actually used in commerce. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §2.56(a), (b)(1); see TMEP §§904, 904.03(g)-(i), 904.07(a). An application based on 
Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in 
commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application or amendment to allege 
use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
A webpage or catalog display specimen (1) must show use of the mark directly associated with the 
goods and (2) such use must be of a point-of-sale nature. 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1). This means that this 
type of display specimen must include the following:
 
(1)        A picture or sufficient textual description of the goods;
 
(2)        The mark associated with the goods; and
 
(3)        A means for ordering the goods such as a “shopping cart” button/link, an 
order form, or a telephone number for placing orders.
 
See In re Sones, 590 F.3d 1282, 1286-89, 93 USPQ2d 1118, 1122-24 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re Azteca 
Sys., Inc., 102 USPQ2d 1955, 1957-58 (TTAB 2012); In re Dell Inc., 71 USPQ2d 1725, 1727 (TTAB 
2004); Lands’ End v. Manbeck, 797 F. Supp. 511, 514, 24 USPQ2d 1314, 1316 (E.D. Va. 1992); 
TMEP §904.03(h), (i)-.03(i)(D).
 
In this case, the specimen does not show sufficient means for ordering the goods. Specifically, the 
specimen shows the mark on the webpage along side a picture and textual description of the goods. 
However, there appears to be no way to purchase the good from the website. Thus, the specimen does 
not constitute a point of sale display and is not acceptable for the class 016 goods. 
 
Accordingly, such material is mere advertising, which is not acceptable as a specimen for goods. See In 
re Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 265039, at *15-16 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re Siny Corp., 
920 F.3d 1331, 1336, 2019 USPQ2d 127099, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. 2019)); see also Avakoff v. S. Pac. Co., 
765 F.2d 1097, 1098, 226 USPQ 435, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §904.04(b), (c).Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  As specified above, a webpage specimen submitted as a display associated 
with the goods must show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and 
include information necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), 
(c).  Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL 
and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the 
specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed 
response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the 
filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for 
the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified substitute 
specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in a signed 
affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or new, or 
originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as 
early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to allege 
use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Applicant should also note the following additional requirements.
 
 
AMENDED IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES REQUIRED
 
Applies to class 041 ONLY
 
The wording “providing and conducting workshops and seminars directed to legal professionals and 
others in the legal field” in the identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because the 
field of the educational series is not stated. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must 
state the specific field or field of the educational services, e.g. law. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:
 
Class 009: Downloadable electronic publications for legal professionals in the nature of magazines, 
manuals and handbooksClass 016: Printed publications, namely, books and manuals for legal professionals and others in the 
legal field
 
Class 035: Association services, namely, promoting the interests of legal professionals and others in the 
legal field
 
Class 041: Educational services, namely, providing and conducting workshops and seminars in the 
field of {state fields of services, e.g. law, business administration, etc.} directed to legal 
professionals and others in the legal field 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and services, but not to broaden or 
expand the goods and services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “EDUCATING CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL SUPPORT 
PROFESSIONALS” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, 
feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 
2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
First, applicant's identification includes "educational services". Thus, EDUCATING" describes a 
function of applicant's services and must be disclaimed. 
 
Second, applicant is located in California. Thus, "CALIFORNIA'S" describes the geographical scope of 
the goods and services and also must be described. 
 
Third, applicant's goods and services are specifically aimed at "legal professionals". Thus, "LEGAL 
SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS" describes the intended audience for applicant's goods and services and 
also must be disclaimed. 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “EDUCATING CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL 
SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
