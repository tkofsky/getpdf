Section 2(d) Refusal – Likelihood of Confusion
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 4954296.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours& 
Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”).  In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.”  In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis:  (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services.  See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01. 
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark “CRAVE+” in stylized text with a design for use in 
connection with “and tobacco substitutes; Electronic cigarettes for use as an alternative to traditional 
cigarettes; Liquid nicotine solutions for use in electronic cigarettes” in International Class 34.
 
Registrant’s mark is "KRAVE" in standard characters for use in connection with “Tobacco water 
pipes” in International Class 34.
 
Comparison of the MarksMarks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
In this case, applicant’s mark is “CRAVE+” and the registrant’s mark is “KRAVE.”
 
Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of 
terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See 
Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), 
aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 
1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH 
confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM 
and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
There is no correct pronunciation of a mark; thus, consumers may pronounce a mark differently than 
intended by the mark owner. See In re Viterra, Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1367, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1912 
(Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Interlego AG v. Abrams/Gentile Entm’t, Inc., 63 USPQ2d 1862, 1863 (TTAB 
2002)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iv). In the present case, the compared wording of the marks could clearly 
be pronounced the same. Such similarity in sound alone may be sufficient to support a finding that the 
compared marks are confusingly similar. In re 1st USA Realty Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 
(TTAB 2007) (citing Krim-Ko Corp. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 390 F.2d 728, 732, 156 USPQ 523, 
526 (C.C.P.A. 1968)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iv).
 
Additionally, when evaluating a composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is 
normally accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be 
remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods and/or services. In re 
Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks 
must be compared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is 
accorded greater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word 
portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant 
Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 
1983)). The fact that applicant's mark is stylized and accompanied by a design element does not obviate 
a likelihood of confusion finding as consumers are more likely to use the wording when referring to the 
mark. 
 
Lastly, where the goods and/or services of an applicant and registrant are “similar in kind and/or 
closely related,” the degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding of likelihood 
of confusion is not as great as in the case of diverse goods and/or services.  In re J.M. Originals Inc., 6 
USPQ2d 1393, 1394 (TTAB 1987); see Shen Mfg. Co. v. Ritz Hotel Ltd., 393 F.3d 1238, 1242, 73 
USPQ2d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2004); TMEP §1207.01(b).Because the literal element of marks in this case look and sound similar and create the same 
commercial impression, the marks are considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes. 
 
Comparison of the Goods
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The applicant’s relevant goods include “Tobacco and tobacco substitutes; Electronic cigarettes for use 
as an alternative to traditional cigarettes; Liquid nicotine solutions for use in electronic cigarettes” in 
International Class 34.
 
The registrant’s relevant goods include “Tobacco water pipes” in International Class 34.
 
Where evidence shows that the goods at issue have complementary uses, and thus are often used 
together or otherwise purchased by the same purchasers for the same or related purposes, such goods 
have generally been found to be sufficiently related such that confusion would be likely if they are 
marketed under the same or similar marks. See In re Martin’s Famous Pastry Shoppe, Inc., 748 F.2d 
1565, 1567, 223 USPQ 1289, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (holding bread and cheese to be related because 
they are often used in combination and noting that “[s]uch complementary use has long been 
recognized as a relevant consideration in determining a likelihood of confusion”); In re Toshiba Med. 
Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1272 (TTAB 2009) (holding medical MRI diagnostic apparatus and 
medical ultrasound devices to be related, based in part on the fact that such goods have complementary 
purposes because they may be used by the same medical personnel on the same patients to treat the 
same disease).
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots from Buffalovapor.com, Facebook.com, and 
Maryjaneshq.com, establishes that the relevant goods are sold or provided through the same trade 
channels and used by the same classes of consumers in the same fields of use, and the goods are similar 
or complementary in terms of purpose or function (i.e., consumers would use the registrant's goods to 
consume the goods of the applicant). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are 
considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 
USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 
1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods are highly related, there is a likelihood of confusion as to 
the source of applicant’s goods. Therefore, applicant’s mark is not entitled to registration.Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirements set forth below.
 
Mark Description Requires Amendment  
 
Applicant submitted a color drawing with a color claim listing the colors in the mark; however, 
applicant did not provide a complete description specifying where each color appears in the literal and 
design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). Therefore, 
applicant must provide a corrected mark description identifying all the colors in the mark and where 
they appear. See TMEP §807.07(a)(ii).
 
Generic color names must be used to describe the colors in the mark, e.g., red, yellow, blue.  TMEP 
§807.07(a)(i)-(ii). If black, white, and/or gray represent background, outlining, shading, and/or 
transparent areas and are not part of the mark, applicant must so specify in the description. See TMEP 
§807.07(d).
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate: “The mark consists of capital letters CRAVE+, 
with the wording "CRAVE" appearing in black with a diagonal blue line making the tail of the 
letter R; an orange plus sign after the word crave; and a blue and orange and white image of a 
flame and water droplet above the word crave."
 
Prior Pending Application
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 90666889 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
