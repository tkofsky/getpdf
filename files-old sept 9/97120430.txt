NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R.§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF OFFICE’S DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the Office’s database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
REQUIREMENT - MARK DESCRIPTION
•
REQUIREMENT - DOMICILE ADDRESS
•
REQUIREMENT - TEAS PLUS STATUS LOST
•
 
REQUIREMENT - MARK DESCRIPTION
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark that agrees with the mark on the drawing. 
37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. The current description is inconsistent with the mark on 
the drawing and thus is inaccurate, in particular the drawing shows a depiction of a feather which the 
mark description describes as a leaf. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. Descriptions must 
be accurate and identify only those literal and design elements appearing in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.37; TMEP §§808.02, 808.03(d).
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate: The mark consists of the design of a stylized 
feather with five five-pointed stars positioned above it. Underneath the feather is the wording "5 
STAR ACUITY" positioned above the wording "NOTARY SERVICES" with the wording 
"ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, AT YOUR SERVICE." appearing further below.
 
REQUIREMENT - DOMICILE ADDRESS
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the attached evidence from the PostNet 
Tucson website indicates that the domicile address of record identifies a post office box or mail 
forwarding service and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal place of residence or 
principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). A domicile address 
must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an individual 
applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal place of business, 
which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct 
and control the entity’s activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
Applications must include an applicant’s domicile address because such domicile determines whether 
an applicant is required to have a U.S.-licensed attorney represent it before the USPTO. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.11(a), 2.32(a)(2); TMEP §§601, 803.05. An applicant whose domicile is located outside of the 
United States or its territories must be represented at the USPTO by an attorney who is an active 
member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a U.S. state or territory. 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); 
TMEP §601.01(a).
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile 
as a post office box or mail forwarding service instead of a street address. In most cases, a post office 
box or mail forwarding service is not acceptable as a domicile address because it does not identify the 
location of applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and controlthe entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1).
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide documentation showing that the listed 
U.S. domicile address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that 
applicant has no fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §§601.01(b)-(b)(1), 803.05(a).
 
If applicant amends the application to list a domicile street address located outside of the United States 
or its territories, applicant must appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney under 37 C.F.R. §11.14 as its 
representative before the application may proceed to registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); TMEP 
§601.01(a). See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information. However, if applicant 
establishes its domicile street address is located within the United States or its territories, applicant is 
not required to appoint a qualified U.S.-licensed attorney. See TMEP §601.01(b).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s domicile address. Applicant should provide the 
most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP 
§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.
 
To appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney in the application, applicant should submit a completed TEAS 
Change Address or Representation form. The newly-appointed attorney must submit a TEAS Response 
to Examining Attorney Office Action form indicating that an appointment of attorney has been made 
and address all other refusals or requirements in this action, if any. Alternatively, if applicant retains an 
attorney before filing the response, the attorney can respond to this Office action by using theappropriate TEAS response form and provide his or her attorney information in the form and sign it as 
applicant’s attorney. See 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b)(1)(ii); TMEP §604.01.
 
REQUIREMENT - TEAS PLUS STATUS LOST
 
Processing fee required. Applicant must submit an additional processing fee of $100 per class because 
the application as filed did not meet the TEAS Plus application filing requirements. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.22(a)(20), (c); TMEP §819.03. Applicant is foreign-domiciled and thus the application must 
designate a U.S.-licensed attorney and include the attorney’s name, postal and email addresses, and bar 
information. 37 C.F.R. §2.22(a)(20). However, applicant provided 8110 S Houghton Rd, Ste 158-
557 Tucson, AZ 85747 as the postal address and the evidence of record indicates that this information 
is not valid because it identifies a post office box or mail forwarding service and does not appear to be 
applicant’s permanent legal place of residence or principal place of business. The additional fee is 
required even if applicant later satisfies this requirement.
 
Accordingly, the application will no longer be treated as TEAS Plus; it is now considered a TEAS 
Standard application.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Response guidelines.  For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action.  For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above.  For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements.  Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
If applicant has questions regarding this Office action, please telephone or e-mail the assigned 
trademark examining attorney.  All relevant e-mail communications will be placed in the official 
application record; however, an e-mail communication will not be accepted as a response to this Office 
action and will not extend the deadline for filing a proper response.  See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.  Further, although the trademark examining attorney may provide 
additional explanation pertaining to the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action, the 
trademark examining attorney may not provide legal advice or statements about applicant’s rights.  See 
TMEP §§705.02, 709.06.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
