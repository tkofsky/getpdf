NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKSThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Sections 1, 2, & 45 Refusal – Title of a Single Work
•
Applicants' Entity Types Uncertain 
•
 
 
SECTIONS 1, 2, & 45 REFUSAL – TITLE OF A SINGLE WORK 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark, as used on the specimen of record, is used only as 
the title of a single creative work, namely, the title of a specific book; it does not function as a 
trademark to identify and distinguish applicant’s goods from those of others and to indicate the source 
of applicant’s goods. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1052, 1127; see Herbko 
Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1162-63, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2002); 
In re Cooper, 254 F.2d 611, 615-16, 117 USPQ 396, 399-400 (C.C.P.A. 1958); TMEP §1202.08.
 
In this case, the submitted specimen shows the applied-for mark, THE SENSATIONALLY SUPER 
SANDY, appearing describe location, on a book cover. Such use shows the mark is displayed 
prominently in a large stylized on the front cover of a book and in a manner consistent with book titles. 
There is no evidence in the application record that applicant’s book is part of a series of creative works, 
nor are there other specimens or evidence in the record otherwise showing proper trademark use of the 
applied-for mark for the identified goods. Therefore, consumers would view the applied-for mark as the 
title of a single work, rather than as a trademark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and to 
distinguish them from the goods of others.
 
In appropriate circumstances, applicant may overcome this refusal by satisfying one of the following 
options:
 
(1) Submit evidence that the applied-for mark is used to identify a series of creative 
works.
 
(2) Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed). This option will later 
necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements.
 
For an overview of these response options and instructions on how to satisfy each option using the 
Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see the Title of a Single Work 
webpage.
 
 
APPLICANTS' ENTITY TYPES UNCERTAIN
 
The name of individual persons, i.e. "Samuels, Jamiyl N" and "Samuels, Tracy-Ann,"appear in the 
sections of the application intended for the trademark owners' names; however, the legal entity is set 
forth each joint applicant is a partnership. Applicants must clarify this inconsistency. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.32(a)(2), (a)(3)(i)-(iii), 2.61(b); TMEP §803.03.If applicants are individuals, applicants must request that the legal entity for each be amended to 
“individual” and must indicate his or her country of citizenship. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(i); TMEP 
§803.03(a).
 
If applicant is a single partnership, applicant must (1) confirm that the individual name is the 
partnership’s name or provide the correct name of the partnership, and (2) specify the state or foreign 
country under whose laws the partnership is organized. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii); TMEP 
§803.03(b). For U.S. partnerships, applicant must also list, if not yet specified, the names, legal entities, 
and national citizenship (for individuals), or the U.S. state or foreign country of organization or 
incorporation (for businesses) of all general partners. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(iii); TMEP §803.03(b). For 
foreign partnerships, the names and citizenships of the general partners are not required. See TMEP 
§803.03(b). 
 
If applicant is a single partnership, applicants may request that the application be amended to delete one 
of the joint applicants.
 
The following format should be used to identify a partnership:
 
U.S. partnership: “_____________________, a partnership organized under the laws of 
_______________, composed of ______________ (specify name, legal entity, and citizenship of 
each individual general partner; and/or name, legal entity, and state or foreign country of 
incorporation or organization of each juristic general partner).”
 
Foreign partnership: “_____________________, a partnership organized under the laws of 
_______________.”
 
Id.
 
Alternatively, if applicant is applying as joint owners/applicants, applicant must specify the names of 
each joint applicant and his or her country of citizenship. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(i); TMEP 
§803.03(d).
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration will be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).
 
 
ADVISORY – HIRING TRADEMARK COUNSEL SUGGESTED 
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for 
more information.

informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191;

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
