SUMMARY OF ISSUES  
Section 2(e)(2) Refusal - Primarily Geographically Descriptive 
•
Information About the Services Required 
•
Supplemental Register Advisory - Amendment To Supplemental Register Suggested With 
Acceptable Proof Of Use
•
Disclaimer Advisory 
•
 
SECTION 2(e)(2) REFUSAL - PRIMARILY GEOGRAPHICALLY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Applicant has applied to register KOREA INVESTMENT & SECURITIES US, INC. for "Capital 
investment; investment of funds; financial investment in the field of securities, real estate, and 
infrastructure projects; project financing; capital investment services; commercial lending services; 
financial services, namely, money lending and syndication of loans; loan financing; financial and 
investment services, namely, asset and investment acquisition" in International Class 36. 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is primarily geographically descriptive of the 
origin of applicant’s services. Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); see TMEP 
§§1210, 1210.01(a).
 
A mark is primarily geographically descriptive when the following is demonstrated:
 
 
(1) The primary significance of the mark to the purchasing public is a generally known 
location;
 
(2) The goods or services originate in the place identified in the mark; and
 
(3) The purchasing public would be likely to believe that the goods or services originate in 
the geographic place identified in the mark; that is, to make a goods-place or services-place 
association.See Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *5 (TTAB 2020) (citing 
In re Nantucket, Inc., 677 F.2d 95, 96-97, 213 USPQ 889, 891 (C.C.P.A. 1982)); see also In re 
Newbridge Cutlery Co., 776 F.3d 854, 860-61, 113 USPQ2d 1445, 1448-49 (Fed. Cir. 2015); In re 
Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1452 (Fed. 
Cir. 1987); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 (TTAB 2001)); TMEP §1210.01(a).
 
In this case, the primary significance of KOREA and US is as a generally known geographic locations. 
The attached evidence from CIA.gov establishes that KOREA identifies the southern half of the Korean 
peninsula. See https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/korea-south/#introduction. 
Further, 
the attached definition from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary establishes that the letters U.S. denote the 
Unites States. See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/us. Thus, the primary significance of 
these terms in the mark is as geographic locations.  
 
A goods-place or services-place association may be presumed where (1) the location in the mark is 
generally known to the purchasing public, (2) the term’s geographical significance is its primary 
significance, and (3) the goods and/or services do, in fact, originate from the named location in the 
mark. TMEP §1210.04; see, e.g., In re Cal. Pizza Kitchen Inc., 10 USPQ2d 1704, 1705 (TTAB 1988) 
(finding a services-place association was presumed between applicant’s restaurant services and 
California because the services originated in California); In re Handler Fenton Ws., Inc., 214 USPQ 
848, 850 (TTAB 1982) (finding a goods-place association was presumed between applicant’s t-shirts 
and Denver because the goods had their geographical origin in Denver); see also In re Nantucket, Inc., 
677 F.2d 95, 102, 213 USPQ 889, 895 (C.C.P.A. 1982) (Nies, J., concurring) (“[W]e must start with the 
concept that a geographic name of a place of business is a descriptive term when used on the goods of 
that business. There is a public goods/place association, in effect, presumed.” (internal footnote 
removed)).
 
The attached evidence from applicant's website establishes that the services originate in the location 
named in the mark. Specifically, the attached evidence indicates that applicant is "one of the leading 
securities companies in Korea. See http://www.truefriend.com/eng/main.jsp. Thus, the term KOREA in 
the mark identifies where the services originate. Further, the attached evidence from applicant's website 
indicates 
that 
the 
services 
are 
provided 
worldwide, 
including 
in 
the 
U.S. See http://www.truefriend.com/eng/company/network01.shtm. Thus, the term US in the mark is 
descriptive of where the services may be provided. Accordingly, the services will originate in the 
places named in the mark. 
 
Further, the additional wording in the mark is highly descriptive or generic for applicant's services. The 
addition of generic or highly descriptive wording to a geographic word or term does not diminish that 
geographic word or term’s primary geographic significance. TMEP §1210.02(c)(ii); see, e.g., Spiritline 
Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *6-7 (TTAB 2020) (holding 
CHARLESTON HARBOR TOURS primarily geographically descriptive of various travel tour and 
cruise services because TOURS is generic for the services and CHARLESTON HARBOR is a well-
known harbor in Charleston, South Carolina); In re Hollywood Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 1852, 
1853-54 (TTAB 2014) (holding HOLLYWOOD LAWYERS ONLINE primarily geographically 
descriptive of attorney referrals, online business information, and an online business directory).
 
In this case, applicant has identified "Capital investment; investment of funds; project financing; 
capital investment services" in International Class 36. (Emphasis added). Thus, the term 
INVESTMENT in the mark names applicant's services. And, the term SECURITIES refers to "Papercertificates (definitive securities) or electronic records (book-entry securities) evidencing ownership of 
equity 
(stocks) 
or 
debt 
obligations 
(bonds)." See https://financial-
dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Securities. Investment services providers commonly provide services 
encompassing 
securities. See 
e.g., https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/securities-
services, https://www.northerntrust.com/united-states/what-we-do/asset-servicing/securities-services. 
Thus, the wording INVESTMENT and SECURITIES merely describes applicant's services.  
 
For the forgoing reasons, the mark is primarily geographically descriptive and registration is refused 
under Section 2(e)(2) of the Trademark Act.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirements set forth below. 
 
INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES REQUIRED
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must provide a written statement specifying 
where the goods and/or services come from or originate. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§814, 
1210.03.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
SUPPLEMENTAL 
REGISTER 
ADVISORY - AMENDMENT 
TO 
SUPPLEMENTAL 
REGISTER SUGGESTED WITH ACCEPTABLE PROOF OF USE
 
Although an amendment to the Supplemental Register would be an appropriate response to this 
refusal in an application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) or 44, such a response is not appropriate 
in the present case. The instant application was filed under Section 1(b) and is not eligible for 
registration on the Supplemental Register until an acceptable amendment to allege use meeting the 
requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been timely filed. 37 C.F.R. §2.47(d); TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03.
 
If applicant files an acceptable allegation of use and also amends to the Supplemental Register, the 
application effective filing date will be the date applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 
37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for an amendment to allege use. TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b). 
In addition, the undersigned trademark examining attorney will conduct a new search of the USPTO 
records for conflicting marks based on the later application filing date. TMEP §§206.01, 1102.03.
 
Although registration on the Supplemental Register does not afford all the benefits of registration on 
the Principal Register, it does provide the following advantages to the registrant:
 
(1)       Use of the registration symbol ® with the registered mark in connection with 
the designated goods and/or services, which provides public notice of the registration and 
potentially deters third parties from using confusingly similar marks.(2)       Inclusion of the registered mark in the USPTO’s database of registered and 
pending marks, which will (a) make it easier for third parties to find it in trademark search 
reports, (b) provide public notice of the registration, and thus (c) potentially deter third 
parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(3)       Use of the registration by a USPTO trademark examining attorney as a bar to 
registering confusingly similar marks in applications filed by third parties.
 
(4)       Use of the registration as a basis to bring suit for trademark infringement in 
federal court, which, although more costly than state court, means judges with more 
trademark experience, often faster adjudications, and the opportunity to seek an injunction, 
actual damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
(5)       Use of the registration as a filing basis for a trademark application for 
registration in certain foreign countries, in accordance with international treaties.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(d), 1091, 1094; J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair 
Competition §§19:33, 19:37 (rev. 4th ed. Supp. 2017).
 
DISCLAIMER ADVISORY  
 
Applicant is advised that, if the application is amended to seek registration on the Principal Register 
under Trademark Act Section 2(f) or on the Supplemental Register, applicant will be required to 
disclaim “INVESTMENT & SECURITIES” because such wording appears to be generic in the context 
of applicant’s goods and/or services. See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Wella Corp., 565 F.2d 143, 144, 
196 USPQ 7, 8 (C.C.P.A. 1977); In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 USPQ 766, 768 (TTAB 
1986); TMEP §1213.03(b).
 
Applicant may submit a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “INVESTMENT & SECURITIES” apart 
from the mark as shown.
 
TMEP §1213.08(a)(i).
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
