Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2) - Refusal to Register Geographically Descriptive Mark
1. 
Specimen Shows Ornamental Use - Registration Refused 
2. 
Applicant's Domicile Address Required 
3. 
 
15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Search Results
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
1.    Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2) - Refusal to Register Geographically Descriptive Mark
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is primarily geographically descriptive of the 
origin of applicant’s goods and/or services. Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); see 
TMEP §§1210, 1210.01(a).
 
The refusal under Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2) is now made FINAL for the reasons set forth below. 
See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); 37 C.F.R. §2.63(b).
 
A mark is primarily geographically descriptive when the following is demonstrated:
 
(1)        The primary significance of the mark to the purchasing public is a generally 
known location;
 
(2)        The goods or services originate in the place identified in the mark; and
 
(3)        The purchasing public would be likely to believe that the goods or services 
originate in the geographic place identified in the mark; that is, to make a goods-place or 
services-place association.
 
See Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *5 (TTAB 2020) (citing 
In re Nantucket, Inc., 677 F.2d 95, 96-97, 213 USPQ 889, 891 (C.C.P.A. 1982)); see also In re 
Newbridge Cutlery Co., 776 F.3d 854, 860-61, 113 USPQ2d 1445, 1448-49 (Fed. Cir. 2015); In reSociete Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1452 (Fed. 
Cir. 1987); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 (TTAB 2001)); TMEP §1210.01(a).  
 
Primary 
significance. The 
attached 
evidence 
from from 
https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/albert-tx 
and 
http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasHillCountryTowns/Albert-Texas.htm shows that "ALBERT" is 
a town in Texas. “TX” is an abbreviation for “Texas,” which is a state in the southern United States. 
See attached definitions from the online American Heritage Dictionary. Together, the primary 
significance of "ALBERT, TX" is to identify a place in Texas.  
 
The primary significance of the design of the map is also geographic. An accurate picture or design of 
geographically descriptive matter and the word or words that describe the design are legal equivalents. 
See In re Can. Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., 86 F.2d 830, 832, 32 USPQ 49, 50 (C.C.P.A. 1936) (holding a 
map of Canada equivalent to the word “Canada” and primarily geographically descriptive of 
applicant’s soft drinks); East Tenn. Packing Co. v. Armour & Co., 102 USPQ 425, 426 (Chief Exam’r 
1954) (finding a map of Tennessee equivalent to the word “Tennessee”); TMEP §1210.02(a). The 
attached 
from 
https://www.tourtexas.com/texas-maps/map-of-texas-cities 
and 
https://ftp.txdot.gov/pub/txdot-info/trv/maps/texas.pdf shows that the shape in the mark is an accurate 
representation of the shape of the state of Texas.  
 
The addition of the highly descriptive "EST. 1892" does not diminish that geographic word or term’s 
primary geographic significance. TMEP §1210.02(c)(ii); see, e.g., Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour 
Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *6-7 (TTAB 2020) (holding CHARLESTON HARBOR 
TOURS primarily geographically descriptive of various travel tour and cruise services because TOURS 
is generic for the services and CHARLESTON HARBOR is a well-known harbor in Charleston, South 
Carolina); In re Hollywood Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 1852, 1853-54 (TTAB 2014) (holding 
HOLLYWOOD LAWYERS ONLINE primarily geographically descriptive of attorney referrals, online 
business information, and an online business directory).
 
“EST” is an abbreviation for “established,” which means “to cause (an institution, for example) to 
come into existence or begin operating; found; set up.” See attached definitions from the online 
American Heritage Dictionary. 
 
See 
attached 
from 
https://www.alberttexas.com/ 
 and 
https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/albert-tx showing that Martinsburg, Texas was renamed 
“Albert” in the year 1982. 
 
The two triangle shaped lines in the mark do not obviate the primary geographic significance of 
"ALBERT, TX". See In re Cambridge Digital Sys., 1 USPQ2d 1659, 1662 (TTAB 1986) 
(CAMBRIDGE DIGITAL and design held primarily geographically descriptive, addition of high 
descriptive wording and design does not detract from geographic significance of the composite); TMEP 
1210.02(c). 
 
Goods/services originate in named place. Goods are considered to originate from a geographic 
location when the record shows that the goods are sold there, manufactured or produced there, 
packaged and shipped from there, and/or contain a main ingredient or component derived from there. 
See, e.g., City of London Distillery, Ltd. v. Hayman Grp. Ltd., 2020 USPQ2d 11487, at *9-10 (TTAB 
2020) (holding applicant’s gin originated within or near the city limits of London, because it was 
distilled in London and bottled just outside of London); In re Joint-Stock Co. “Baik,” 80 USPQ2d1305, 1310 (TTAB 2006) (holding applicant’s vodka originated from BAIKALSKAYA, a Russian 
word meaning “from Baikal,” because it was made from the water of Lake Baikal and applicant 
produced various vodkas from a location near Lake Baikal); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 
1083 (TTAB 2001) (holding applicant’s cigars, cigar cases, and humidors originated from 
MINNESOTA because they were packaged and shipped from MINNESOTA, and applicant’s business 
was located in MINNESOTA); TMEP §1210.03.
 
For services to originate in a geographic place, the record must show that they are rendered at least in 
part in the geographic place. See In re Chalk’s Int’l Airline Inc., 21 USPQ2d 1637 (TTAB 1991) 
(holding PARADISE ISLAND AIRLINES primarily geographically descriptive of air transportation 
services of passengers and/or goods that are performed at least in part on Paradise Island); In re Cal. 
Pizza Kitchen Inc., 10 USPQ2d 1704 (TTAB 1988) (holding CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN 
primarily geographically descriptive of restaurant services rendered in California and outside the state 
as well); In re Opryland USA Inc., 1 USPQ2d 1409 (TTAB 1986) (holding THE NASHVILLE 
NETWORK primarily geographically descriptive of television production and distribution services 
provided in Nashville); TMEP §1210.03.
 
In this case, the goods and services originate in Albert, Texas. See attached from applicant's website 
at https://www.alberttexas.com/ listing applicant's address as "Albert-Stonewall, TX."
 
Goods/services place association presumed. A goods-place or services-place association may be 
presumed where (1) the location in the mark is generally known to the purchasing public, (2) the term’s 
geographical significance is its primary significance, and (3) the goods and/or services do, in fact, 
originate from the named location in the mark. TMEP §1210.04; see, e.g., In re Cal. Pizza Kitchen Inc., 
10 USPQ2d 1704, 1705 (TTAB 1988) (finding a services-place association was presumed between 
applicant’s restaurant services and California because the services originated in California); In re 
Handler Fenton Ws., Inc., 214 USPQ 848, 850 (TTAB 1982) (finding a goods-place association was 
presumed between applicant’s t-shirts and Denver because the goods had their geographical origin in 
Denver); see also In re Nantucket, Inc., 677 F.2d 95, 102, 213 USPQ 889, 895 (C.C.P.A. 1982) (Nies, 
J., concurring) (“[W]e must start with the concept that a geographic name of a place of business is a 
descriptive term when used on the goods of that business. There is a public goods/place association, in 
effect, presumed.” (internal footnote removed)).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. 
 
Advisory re Supplemental Register. The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the 
Principal Register. Applicant may respond to the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in 
support of registration and/or by amending the application to seek registration on the Supplemental 
Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816. Amending to the 
Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant from submitting evidence and arguments against the 
refusal(s). TMEP §816.04. 
  
2.         Specimen Shows Ornamental Use - Registration Refused 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark as used on the specimen of record is merely a 
decorative or ornamental feature of applicant’s clothing and, thus, does not function as a trademark to 
indicate the source of applicant’s clothing and to identify and distinguish applicant’s clothing from 
others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1052, 1127; see In re LululemonAthletica Can. Inc., 105 USPQ2d 1684, 1689 (TTAB 2013); In re Pro-Line Corp., 28 USPQ2d 1141, 
1142 (TTAB 1993); TMEP §§904.07(b), 1202.03 et seq.
 
The size, location, dominance, and significance of the alleged mark as used on the goods are all 
relevant factors in determining the commercial impression of the applied-for mark. See, e.g., In re 
Peace Love World Live, LLC, 127 USPQ2d 1400, 1403 (TTAB 2018) (quoting In re Hulting, 107 
USPQ2d 1175, 1178 (TTAB 2013)); In re Lululemon Athletica Can. Inc., 105 USPQ2d at 1687 
(quoting In re Right-On Co., 87 USPQ2d 1152, 1156 (TTAB 2008)); TMEP §1202.03(a).
 
With respect to clothing, consumers may recognize small designs or discrete wording as trademarks, 
rather than as merely ornamental features, when located, for example, on the pocket or breast area of a 
shirt. See TMEP §1202.03(a). Consumers may not, however, perceive larger designs or slogans as 
trademarks when such matter is prominently displayed across the front of a t-shirt. See In re Pro-Line 
Corp., 28 USPQ2d at 1142; In re Dimitri’s Inc., 9 USPQ2d 1666, 1667-68 (TTAB 1988); TMEP 
§1202.03(a), (b), (f)(i), (f)(ii).
 
In this case, the submitted specimen shows the applied-for mark,  , located directly on the front and 
center of the shirt, where ornamental elements often appear. See TMEP §1202.03(a), (b). Furthermore, 
the mark is displayed in a relatively large size on the clothing such that it dominates the overall 
appearance of the goods. Lastly, the applied-for mark appears to be a design element that is used in a 
merely decorative manner that would be perceived by consumers as having little or no particular 
source-identifying significance.
 
Therefore, consumers would view the applied-for mark as a decorative or ornamental feature of the 
goods, rather than as a trademark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and to distinguish them 
from others.
 
In appropriate circumstances, applicant may overcome this refusal by satisfying one of the following 
options:
 
(1)       Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application (or prior to the 
filing of an amendment to allege use) and that shows proper trademark use for the 
identified goods in International Class 25. Examples of acceptable specimens that show 
non-ornamental use on clothing include hang tags and labels used inside a garment.
 
(2)       Amend to the Supplemental Register, which is a second trademark register 
for marks not yet eligible for registration on the Principal Register, but which may become 
capable over time of functioning as source indicators.
 
(3)       Claim acquired distinctiveness under Trademark Act Section 2(f) by 
submitting evidence that the applied-for mark has become distinctive of applicant’s goods; 
that is, proof that applicant’s extensive use and promotion of the mark allowed consumers 
now directly to associate the mark with applicant as the source of the goods.
 
(4)       Submit evidence that the applied-for mark is an indicator of secondary 
source; that is, proof that the mark is already recognized as a source indicator for other 
goods or services that applicant sells/offers.(5)       Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b). This option will 
later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements.
 
For an overview of the response options above and instructions on how to satisfy each option online 
using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Ornamental Refusal 
webpage.
 
3.         Applicant's Domicile Address Required 
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record identifies 
“c/o” or in “care of” another party’s address and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal 
place of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). 
The application lists the same address for the applicant and the attorney of record, and the attached 
from https://haylegal.com/contact-us/ shows that the address "611 W 5th St Suite 300 Austin TX 
78701" is the address of The Hay Legal Group, PLLC. A domicile address must identify either (1) the 
permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an individual applicant resides and intends to be 
the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal place of business, which is the juristic applicant’s 
headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  
See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a). All applications must include the applicant’s domicile 
address, which is required for a complete application. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.22(a)(1), 2.32(a)(2), 2.189.
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile 
as “c/o” or in “care of” another party’s address. In most cases, an address that is listed as “c/o” or in 
“care of” another party’s address is not acceptable as a domicile address because it does not identify the 
location of applicant’s headquarters where the entity’s senior executives or officers ordinarily direct 
and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1).
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide (1) documentation showing that the listed 
address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that applicant has no 
fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §601.01(b)-(b)(1).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s domicile address. Applicant should provide the 
most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP 
§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number,answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.

•United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120257
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
