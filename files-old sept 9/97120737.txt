Description of the Mark

SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature, ingredient, 
characteristic, purpose, function, intended audience of applicant's goods and/or services.  Trademark 
Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant's goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).   However, the determination 
of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant's goods and/or services, not 
in the abstract. DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1254, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 
1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b). “Whether consumers could guess 
what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the test.” In re Am. 
Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).
 
In this case, applicant has applied to register the mark FORKLIFTTRADER.COM, in connection with 
the following goods: fork lift trucks.
 
As demonstrated by the attached dictionary evidence, the term "trader" is defined as a merchant.  Please 
see the attached evidence. In addition, applicant's identification indicates that.the goods are fork lift 
trucks.  The non-source-identifying generic top-level domain (gTLD) “.com” merely indicates an 
Internet address for use by commercial, for-profit organizations. See, e.g., Booking.com B.V. v. USPTO, 
915 F.3d 171, 185 (4th Cir. 2019), aff’d, 140 S. Ct. 2298, 2304, 2020 USPQ2d 10729, at *2 (2020) 
(“Where the proposed mark is a composite that includes .com, we clarify that . . . .com does not itself 
have source-identifying significance when added to [a second-level domain] like booking.”); In re 
1800Mattress.com IP LLC, 586 F.3d 1359, 1364, 92 USPQ2d 1682, 1685 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re 
Oppedahl & Larsen LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1175-77, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1373-74 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see 
also TMEP §§1209.03(m), 1215.01.  As such here, the wording, FORKLIFTTRADER.COM merely 
describes the goods because it immediately conveys information about them, namely, that they 
originate from a commercial enterprise as in a merchant that provides fork lifts.   In addition, the 
attached evidence from applicant's website further confirms the descriptive significance as describing amerchant/dealer specializing in forklifts.  Please see the attached evidence.
 
Generally, where the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods as here, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not registrable. 
In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re Tower Tech, 
Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS Meditech 
Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as hypodermic, 
aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 (TTAB 
2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner that is an 
integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services is the combined mark 
registrable. See In re Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial 
Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 
364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant's 
goods and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods.
 
It is noted that applicant's applied-for mark includes stylization and common border.  However, 
descriptive significance is not obviated.  Background designs in composite marks consisting of 
common geometric shapes, such as circles, ovals, squares, triangles, diamonds, and other geometric 
designs, are generally not regarded as marks for goods and/or services absent a showing of 
distinctiveness in the design alone. In re Anton/Bauer Inc., 7 USPQ2d 1380, 1381 (TTAB 1988) (citing 
In re Raytheon Co., 202 USPQ 317 (TTAB 1979)); TMEP §1202.11; see also Seabrook Foods, Inc. v. 
Bar-Well Foods Ltd., 568 F.2d 1342, 1344, 196 USPQ 289, 291 (C.C.P.A. 1977).  Moreover, stylized 
descriptive or generic wording is registrable only where the stylization creates a commercial impression 
separate and apart from the impression made by the wording itself. See In re Cordua Rests., Inc., 823 
F.3d 594, 606, 118 USPQ2d 1632, 1639-40 (Fed. Cir. 2016); In re Northland Aluminum Prods., Inc., 
777 F.2d 1556, 1561, 227 USPQ 961, 964 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §1209.03(w). Common and 
ordinary lettering with minimal stylization, as in this case, is generally not sufficiently striking, unique, 
or distinctive as to make an impression on purchasers separate from the wording. See In re Sadoru 
Grp., Ltd., 105 USPQ2d 1484, 1487 (TTAB 2012).  Here, neither the common background nor 
stylization creates a distinctive impression separate from the wording and thus, the descriptive 
significance is not obviated.
 
Applicant should note the following additional ground for refusal.
 
UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMEN OF USE -- Advertising for goods is not an acceptable specimen. 
 
Registration is also refused because the specimen appears to be mere advertising and does not properly 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in International Class(es) 12. Trademark Act 
Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.04(b), 904.07(a). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods 
identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).Specifically, applicant submitted an excerpt from applicant's website showing use of the mark with 
respect to applicant's merchant services. The mark does not appear to identify particular forklifts but the 
service providing used forklift sales and rentals.
 
Advertising is not acceptable as a specimen for goods. See In re Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 
USPQ2d 265039, at *15-16 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re Siny Corp., 920 F.3d 1331, 1336, 2019 
USPQ2d 127099, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. 2019)); see also Avakoff v. S. Pac. Co., 765 F.2d 1097, 1098, 226 
USPQ 435, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §904.04(b), (c). Advertising includes online advertising 
banners appearing on search-engine results pages or in social media, advertising circulars and 
brochures, price lists, and business cards. See TMEP §904.04(b).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c).  Any webpage 
printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was 
accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a 
verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Although applicant's mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. If applicant responds to the refusal(s), 
applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.DESCRIPTION OF THE MARK
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark that agrees with the mark on the drawing. 
37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. The current description is inconsistent with the mark on 
the drawing and thus is inaccurate. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. Descriptions must be 
accurate and identify only those literal and design elements appearing in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §2.37; 
TMEP §§808.02, 808.03(d).
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate: The mark consists of the red stylized text 
"ForkliftTrader" that is white color outlined. Around the white outline is a black line outline. To the 
right of this text is a black oval that is outlined with white. Around this white is also a black line 
outline. In the middle of the black oval is stylized white text ".com."

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
