2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKSThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive
1. 
Request for Information - Response Required
2. 
Advisory: Amendment to Supplemental Register Suggested But Not Permitted Until Acceptable 
AAU Is Filed
3. 
Advisory: Applicant May Wish To Seek Trademark Counsel
4. 
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL – MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature, characteristic, purpose, 
function, and/or use of applicant’s services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see 
TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, and/or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re 
TriVita, Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl 
& Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
In the present case, the applied-for mark is FORENSYCS for "[c]omputer security threat analysis for 
protecting data" in International Class 042.  Here, the wording FORENSYCS appears to be a novel or 
intentional misspelling of the wording forensics, which according to The American Heritage 
Dictionary, can be defined as "[t]he use of science and technology to investigate and establish 
facts...".  See attached for dictionary definition.
 
A novel spelling or an intentional misspelling that is the phonetic equivalent of a merely descriptive 
word or term is also merely descriptive if purchasers would perceive the different spelling as the 
equivalent of the descriptive word or term. See In re Quik-Print Copy Shop, Inc., 616 F.2d 523, 526 & 
n.9, 205 USPQ 505, 507 & n.9 (C.C.P.A. 1980) (holding “QUIK-PRINT,” phonetic spelling of “quick-
print,” merely descriptive of printing and photocopying services); In re Calphalon Corp., 122 USPQ2d 
1153, 1163 (TTAB 2017) (holding “SHARPIN”, phonetic spelling of “sharpen,” merely descriptive of 
cutlery knife blocks with built-in sharpeners); In re Carlson, 91 USPQ2d 1198, 1203 (TTAB 2009) 
(holding “URBANHOUZING,” phonetic spelling of “urban” and “housing,” merely descriptive of real 
estate services); TMEP §1209.03(j).
 
As such, when the applied-for mark is considered in connection with the identified services, it is 
immediately descriptive.  This is because it conveys, without any ambiguity, a feature, characteristic, 
purpose, function, and/or use of applicant’s services, namely, forensic services in the form of computer 
security threat analysis for protecting data. 
 
Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the applied-for mark is refused registration on the Principal 
Register under Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1).Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - RESPONSE REQUIRED 
 
Due to the descriptive nature of the applied-for mark, applicant must provide the following information 
and documentation regarding the services and wording appearing in the mark:
 
(1)        Fact sheets, instruction manuals, brochures, advertisements and pertinent screenshots of 
applicant’s website as it relates to the services in the application, including any materials using the 
terms in the applied-for mark. Merely stating that information about the services is available on 
applicant’s website is insufficient to make the information of record.;
 
(2)        If these materials are unavailable, applicant should submit similar documentation for 
services of the same type, explaining how its own services will differ. If the services feature new 
technology and information regarding competing services is not available, applicant must provide a 
detailed factual description of the services. Factual information about the services must make clear 
what the services are and how they are rendered, salient features, and prospective customers and 
channels of trade. Conclusory statements will not satisfy this requirement.; and
 
(3)        Applicant must respond to the following questions:
 
Do the identified services feature any type of forensics in any way, shape or 
form?
•
Do the identified services involve any type of forensics in any way, shape or 
form? 
•
Do the identified services utilize any type of forensics in any way, shape or 
form?
•
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§814, 1402.01(e).
 
If applicant submits webpage evidence to satisfy this requirement, applicant must provide (1) an image 
of the webpage, (2) the date it was accessed or printed, and (3) the complete URL address. In re ADCO 
Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 
1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018)); TMEP §710.01(b). Providing only a website address or hyperlink to the 
webpage is not sufficient to make the materials of record. In re ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 
USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (citing In re Olin Corp., 124 USPQ2d 1327, 1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB 
Solomon Assocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); TBMP §1208.03); TMEP §814.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
ADVISORY: AMENDMENT TO SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTER SUGGESTED BUT NOTPERMITTED UNTIL ACCEPTABLE AAU IS FILED 
 
Although an amendment to the Supplemental Register would be an appropriate response to this 
refusal in an application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) or 44, such a response is not appropriate 
in the present case. The instant application was filed under Section 1(b) and is not eligible for 
registration on the Supplemental Register until an acceptable amendment to allege use meeting the 
requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been timely filed. 37 C.F.R. §2.47(d); TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03.
 
If applicant files an acceptable allegation of use and also amends to the Supplemental Register, the 
application effective filing date will be the date applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 
37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for an amendment to allege use. TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b). 
In addition, the undersigned trademark examining attorney will conduct a new search of the USPTO 
records for conflicting marks based on the later application filing date. TMEP §§206.01, 1102.03.
 
Although registration on the Supplemental Register does not afford all the benefits of registration on 
the Principal Register, it does provide the following advantages to the registrant:
 
(1)       Use of the registration symbol ® with the registered mark in connection with the 
designated goods and/or services, which provides public notice of the registration and potentially deters 
third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(2)       Inclusion of the registered mark in the USPTO’s database of registered and pending 
marks, which will (a) make it easier for third parties to find it in trademark search reports, (b) provide 
public notice of the registration, and thus (c) potentially deter third parties from using confusingly 
similar marks.
 
(3)       Use of the registration by a USPTO trademark examining attorney as a bar to registering 
confusingly similar marks in applications filed by third parties.
 
(4)       Use of the registration as a basis to bring suit for trademark infringement in federal court, 
which, although more costly than state court, means judges with more trademark experience, often 
faster adjudications, and the opportunity to seek an injunction, actual damages, and attorneys’ fees and 
costs.
 
(5)       Use of the registration as a filing basis for a trademark application for registration in 
certain foreign countries, in accordance with international treaties.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(d), 1091, 1094; J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair 
Competition §§19:33, 19:37 (rev. 4th ed. Supp. 2017).

number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
