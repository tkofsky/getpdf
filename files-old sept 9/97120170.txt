Office Action (Official Letter) About Applicant’s Trademark Application
 
U.S. Application Serial No. 97120170
Mark:  WILD DOE NATURALS
Correspondence Address:  
MICHAEL A. SWIFT 
MAGINOT, MOORE & BECK LLP 
ONE INDIANA SQUARE, SUITE 2200 
INDIANAPOLIS IN 46204 UNITED STATES
Applicant:  Mr. Eric Young
Reference/Docket No. 2631-0001
Correspondence Email Address:  maswift@maginot.com
 
 
NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Disclaimer Required
•
Domicile Clarification Required
•
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “NATURALS” because it is merely descriptive of a feature of 
applicant’s goods.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 
695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from the American Heritage Dictionary shows this wording means "Of, relating 
to, or concerning nature" and "Not altered, treated".  Thus, the wording merely describes applicant’s 
goods, namely, applicant's skin care products are not altered or treated.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “NATURALS” apart from the mark as 
shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
DOMICILE CLARIFICATION REQUIRED
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record identifies a 
post office box or mail forwarding service and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal place 
of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). A 
domicile address must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an 
individual applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal place 
of business, which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a). All 
applications must include the applicant’s domicile address, which is required for a complete 
application. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.22(a)(1), 2.32(a)(2), 2.189.
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as an individual and specifies applicant’s domicile as 
a post office box or mail forwarding service instead of a street address. In most cases, a post office box 
or mail forwarding service is not acceptable as a domicile address because it does not identify the 
location of the place applicant resides and intends to be applicant’s principal home. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1).
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide (1) documentation showing that the listedaddress is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that applicant has no 
fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §601.01(b)-(b)(1).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s domicile address. Applicant should provide 
documentation showing the name and listed domicile address of the individual, for example one of the 
following: (1) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement; (2) a current, valid 
homeowner’s, renter’s, or motor vehicle insurance policy; or (3) a computer-generated bill issued by a 
utility company dated no earlier than 60 days before the application filing date. TMEP §601.01(b)-
(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed domicile address, 
and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical place where applicant resides and intends to be its principal home, applicant should state for 
the record that applicant has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the 
circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.
 
ASSISTANCE: Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about 
this Office action. Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney 
can provide additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See

The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120170
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
