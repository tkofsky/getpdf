NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
 
IntroductionThe referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues
 
Partial Refusal - Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion
•
 
Partial Refusal - Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion 
 
THIS PARTIAL REFUSAL APPLIES ONLY TO THE GOODS SPECIFIED HEREIN
 
Registration of the applied-for mark "WOODEPOCH" is refused because of a likelihood of confusion 
with the marks in U.S. Registration Nos. 2759668 ("EPOCH DESIGN") and 3481209 ("EPOCH"). 
Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached 
registrations.
 
This partial refusal applies only to the goods in International Class 020 identified as "Bamboo 
furniture; Bentwood furniture; ... Pet furniture in the nature of cat trees, cat condos; Placards of wood 
or plastics." 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark WOODEPOCH in standard characters for “Bamboo 
furniture; Bentwood furniture; Bird houses; Decorative boxes made of wood; Decorative decoys made 
of plastic; Display cases for merchandise; Display racks for cosmetics; Garden ornaments in the nature 
of wooden whirligigs; Ornaments of plaster, plastic, wax, wood; Pet furniture in the nature of cat trees, 
cat condos; Placards of wood or plastics; Wood storage tanks; Wooden craft sticks; Wooden display 
stands; Works of art made of wood; Works of art of plastic” in International Class 020.
 
Registrant’s mark is EPOCH DESIGN in typed characters for “FURNITURE” in International Class020. 
 
Registrant’s mark is EPOCH in standard characters for “Non-metal goods made from lucite or wood, 
namely, trophies and plaques” in International Class 020. 
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Here, applicant’s mark, WOODEPOCH, is confusingly similar to the registered marks, EPOCH 
DESIGN and EPOCH. 
 
WOODEPOCH vs. EPOCH DESIGN 
 
Consumers will likely perceive the marks as "WOOD EPOCH"/"EPOCH DESIGN", which means that 
consumers will perceive the marks as containing the identical wording "EPOCH." 
 
Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of 
terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See 
Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), 
aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 
1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH 
confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM 
and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
Additionally, the fact that the marks contain the additional wording "WOOD"/"DESIGN" does not 
diminish the confusing nature of the marks because the shared wording "EPOCH" is the more 
distinctive wording in the marks.
 
Although there is no mechanical test to determine the dominant element of a mark, consumers would 
be more likely to perceive a distinctive term, even if suggestive, rather than a generic or descriptive 
term as the source-identifying feature of the mark. Tao Licensing, LLC v. Bender Consulting Ltd., 125 
USPQ2d 1043, 1059-60 (TTAB 2017) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406-07, 41 
USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997); In re Binion, 93 USPQ2d 1531, 1534 (TTAB 2009)).
 
In the present case, the additional wording "DESIGN" in the registrant's mark merely describes 
registrant's goods, as evidenced by the fact this wording is disclaimed.  Likewise, the additional 
wording "WOOD" in the applicant's mark merely describes applicant's goods, as evidenced by the fact 
this wording appears in applicant's identification of goods ("Bentwood furniture; ... Decorative boxes 
made of wood; ... Garden ornaments in the nature of wooden whirligigs; Ornaments of plaster, plastic, 
wax, wood; ... Placards of wood or plastics; Wood storage tanks; Wooden craft sticks; Woodendisplay stands; Works of art made of wood" (emphasis added)).  Thus, because the more 
distinctive wording in applicant's mark, EPOCH, is identical to the more distinctive wording in 
registrant's mark, EPOCH, the marks create an overall similar commercial impression.
 
Accordingly, because the marks create the same commercial impression, the marks are considered 
similar for likelihood of confusion purposes. 
 
WOODEPOCH vs. EPOCH 
 
Consumers will likely perceive the marks as "WOOD EPOCH"/"EPOCH", which means that 
consumers will perceive the marks as containing the identical wording "EPOCH." 
 
The fact that applicant's mark contains the additional wording "WOOD" does not diminish the 
confusing nature of the marks.
 
Adding a term to a registered mark generally does not obviate the similarity between the compared 
marks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d). See 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106 
(C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL and BENGAL LANCER and design confusingly similar); In re 
Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1269 (TTAB 2009) (holding TITAN and VANTAGE 
TITAN confusingly similar); In re El Torito Rests., Inc., 9 USPQ2d 2002, 2004 (TTAB 1988) (holding 
MACHO and MACHO COMBOS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii). In the present case, 
the marks are identical in part.
 
This is particularly true in the present case where the additional wording "WOOD" in applicant's mark 
is merely descriptive of applicant's goods.  See above for an explanation of the descriptiveness of this 
wording.
 
Thus, because the more distinctive wording in applicant's mark, EPOCH, is identical to the entirety of 
registrant's mark, EPOCH, the marks create an overall similar commercial impression. 
 
Accordingly, because the marks create the same commercial impression, the marks are considered 
similar for likelihood of confusion purposes. 
 
Relatedness of the Goods 
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
U.S. Registration No. 2759668 ("EPOCH DESIGN") 
 
In this case, the registration uses broad wording ("FURNITURE") to describe the goods, which 
presumably encompasses all goods and/or services of the type described, including applicant’s more 
narrow goods identified as "Bamboo furniture; Bentwood furniture; ... Pet furniture in the nature of cat 
trees, cat condos."  See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); 
Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and 
registrant’s goods are legally identical in part.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627,1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 
209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 
(TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Accordingly, the goods and/or services are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of 
confusion analysis. 
 
U.S. Registration No. 3481209 ("EPOCH") 
 
In this case, the registration uses broad wording ("Non-metal goods made from lucite or wood, namely, 
trophies and plaques") to describe the goods, which presumably encompasses all goods and/or services 
of the type described, including applicant’s more narrow goods identified as "Placards of wood or 
plastics."  See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. 
Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and 
registrant’s goods are legally identical in part.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 
1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 
209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 
(TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Accordingly, the goods and/or services are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of 
confusion analysis.
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods and/or services are legally identical, there is a likelihood 
of confusion as to the source of applicant’s goods and/or services, and registration is refused pursuant 
to Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.
