NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
The undersigned trademark examining attorney has reviewed the referenced application. Applicant 
must respond completely to the issues that are discussed below by the above-referenced deadline. 15 
U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.The office records have been searched, and no similar registered or pending mark has been found that 
would bar registration pursuant to Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). TMEP §704.02. 
 
Registration Refused - Premature Use 
 
Registration is refused because the specimen and evidence show that applicant had not used the 
applied-for mark in commerce in connection with the identified services as of the application filing 
date. Trademark Act Sections 1(a) and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051(a), 1127; 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(1)(i); see 
TMEP §§904, 1301.03(a)-(b). The specimen and evidence show that applicant was preparing to offer 
the services as of the application filing date. The use or display of a mark in the advertising of 
the services before the services are actually rendered does not show use in commerce. See Couture v. 
Playdom, Inc., 778 F.3d 1379, 1380-82, 113 USPQ2d 2042, 2043-44 (Fed. Cir. 2015); In re Suuberg, 
2021 USPQ2d 1209, *7-8 (TTAB 2021); TMEP §§904, 1301.03(a)-(b).
 
If applicant’s services were being rendered in commerce as of the application filing date, applicant 
must submit the following:
 
(1) A different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) showing the applied-for mark in use 
in commerce for the services that are specified in the application. Any webpage printout or 
screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage's URL and the screenshot capture 
date on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified 
statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(2) The following statement, verified with an affidavit or signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. 
§2.20: “The substitute specimen was in use in commerce at least as early as the application 
filing date.” 37 C.F.R. §2.59(a); TMEP §904.05; see 37 C.F.R. §2.193(e)(1). If submitting a 
substitute specimen requires an amendment to the dates of use, applicant must also verify the 
amended dates. 37 C.F.R. §2.71(c); TMEP §904.05.
 
If applicant did not use the applied-for mark in commerce on or before the filing date, applicant may 
substitute a different basis for filing if applicant can meet the requirements for the new basis. In this 
case, applicant may wish to amend the application to assert a Section 1(b) basis. See TMEP §806.03(c). 
However, if applicant amends the basis to Section 1(b), registration will not be granted until applicant 
later amends the application back to use in commerce by filing an acceptable allegation of use with a 
proper specimen. See 15 U.S.C. §1051(c), (d); 37 C.F.R. §§2.76, 2.88; TMEP §1103. If the same 
specimen is submitted with an allegation of use, the same refusal will issue.
 
To amend to Section 1(b), applicant must submit the following statement, verified with an affidavit or 
signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “Applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in 
commerce and had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the application filing 
date.” 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2); TMEP §806.01(b); see 15 U.S.C. §1051(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.35(b)(1), 
2.193(e)(1).
 
If applicant responds to the refusal, applicant must also respond to the issues that are discussed below.
 
Applicant Must Amend The IdentificationThis requirement applies to: providing an on-line computer game in the field of transactional games, 
greetings and gifts. 
 
Applicant must clarify some of the wording in the identification, as shown below, because it is 
indefinite. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. The wording is indefinite because it 
does not make clear the exact nature of the services. 
 
Wording that appears within brackets offers guidance. And wording that should be deleted is shown 
with a line through it as follows: strikethrough. Applicant should enter amendments in standard font, 
not in strikethrough or within brackets.
 
Please note that wording that appears in strikethrough in the suggested identification would appear in 
standard font when copied and pasted. Therefore, any deletions must be made manually.
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate:
 
"Entertainment services, namely, providing on-line computer games; Entertainment services, 
namely, providing online browser-based video games; Entertainment services, namely, providing 
online co-op video games; Entertainment services, namely, providing online computer games 
that help maintain an active brain and thus improve memory, speed of processing, and that 
provide a variety of cognitive benefits that positively impact quality of life; Entertainment 
services, namely, providing online electronic games; Entertainment services, namely, providing 
online first-person shooter (FPS) video games; Entertainment services, namely, providing online 
multiplayer video games; Entertainment services, namely, providing online player versus player 
(PvP) video games; Entertainment services, namely, providing online video games; 
Entertainment services, namely, providing an on-line board game; Entertainment services, 
namely, providing an on-line computer game; Entertainment services, namely, providing brain 
training games on-line and in mobile wireless form; Providing on-line card games; Providing on-
line poker games; Providing online augmented reality games; Providing online non-
downloadable game software; Providing online non-downloadable game software for playing a 
treasure hunting game using GPS coordinates; Providing a web-based system and on-line portal 
for customers to participate in on-line gaming, operation and coordination of game tournaments, 
leagues and tours for recreational computer game playing purposes; Providing an on-line 
computer game in the field of transactional games, greetings and gifts {this wording is unclear; 
applicant must clarify}; Providing information on-line relating to computer games and computer 
enhancements for games; Providing on-line computer games; Virtual reality game services 
provided on-line from a computer network," in International Class 41. 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand 
the services beyond those originally identified in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted services may not be reinserted into the 
identification. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO's online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Requirement For InformationThis requirement applies to: providing an on-line computer game in the field of transactional games, 
greetings and gifts.
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must submit additional information about 
applicant's services because the nature of the services is not clear from the present record. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§814, 1402.01(e). The required information should include fact sheets, 
brochures, 
and/or 
advertisements 
and 
promotional 
materials. 
If 
these 
materials 
are 
unavailable, applicant should submit similar documentation for services of the same type, explaining 
how its own services will differ. If the services feature new technology and no information regarding 
competing services is available, applicant must provide a detailed factual description of the services.
 
If applicant submits webpage evidence to satisfy this requirement, applicant must provide (1) an image 
of the webpage, (2) the date the screenshot was captured, and (3) the complete URL. In re ADCO 
Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 
1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018)); TMEP §710.01(b). Providing only a website address or hyperlink to the 
webpage is not sufficient to make the materials of record. In re ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 
USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (citing In re Olin Corp., 124 USPQ2d 1327, 1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB 
Solomon Assocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); TBMP §1208.03); TMEP §814. 
 
Applicant must respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re Ocean 
Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 1644, 
1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
The Specimen Is Not Acceptable 
 
Specimen does not show use for the services. Registration is refused because the specimen does not 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in connection with any of the services that are 
identified in the application. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79 (TTAB 2017); 
TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(d), (g)(i). An application that is based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) 
must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each 
international class of goods and/or services that is identified in the application. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 
37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 
106 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013).
 
Specifically, the specimen shows use of the mark in connection with a VIP club. It does not show that 
applicant offers any of the services that are recited in the identification.
 
Examples of specimens. Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include (1) advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or 
billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any screenshot that is submitted as a specimen must include the webpage's URL and the screenshot 
capture date. This information must be provided on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form to which 
the specimen is attached, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1) Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual use in 
commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application and (b) shows the mark in actual 
use in commerce for the services that are identified in the application. A “verified substitute 
specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in a signed 
affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or new, or 
originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as 
the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.” The 
substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2) Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b), as no specimen is required before 
publication. This option would later necessitate additional fees and filing requirements, including 
a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the specimen 
webpage.
 
Applicant Must Clarify Its Domicile Address 
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record identifies a 
Parcels Plus store and does not appear to be applicant’s principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). A domicile address must identify the principal place of 
business, which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily 
direct and control the entity's activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
Applications must include an applicant’s domicile address because such domicile determines whether 
an applicant is required to have a U.S.-licensed attorney represent it before the USPTO. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.11(a), 2.32(a)(2); TMEP §§601, 803.05. An applicant whose domicile is located outside of the 
United States or its territories must be represented at the USPTO by an attorney who is an active 
member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a U.S. state or territory. 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); 
TMEP §601.01(a).
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile 
as a Parcels Plus store. See attachment. In most cases, such an address is not acceptable as a domicile 
address because it does not identify the location of applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives 
or officers ordinarily direct and control the entity's activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP 
§601.01(b)(1).
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide documentation showing that the listed 
U.S. domicile address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that 
applicant has no fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §§601.01(b)-(b)(1), 803.05(a).
 
If applicant amends the application to list a domicile street address located outside of the United Statesor its territories, applicant must appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney under 37 C.F.R. §11.14 as its 
representative before the application may proceed to registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); TMEP 
§601.01(a). See hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information. However, if applicant 
establishes its domicile street address is located within the United States or its territories, applicant is 
not required to appoint a qualified U.S.-licensed attorney. See TMEP §601.01(b).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s domicile address. Applicant should provide the 
most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP 
§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.
 
To appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney in the application, applicant should submit a completed TEAS 
change address or representation form. The newly-appointed attorney must submit a TEAS response to 
examining attorney office action form indicating that an appointment of attorney has been made and 
address all other refusals or requirements in this action, if any. Alternatively, if applicant retains an 
attorney before filing the response, the attorney can respond to this Office action by using the 
appropriate TEAS response form and provide his or her attorney information in the form and sign it as 
applicant’s attorney. See 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b)(1)(ii); TMEP §604.01.
 
Applicant Is Encouraged To Hire An Attorney 
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance, i.e., explaining the contentof an office action and the application process, but cannot provide legal advice. TMEP §§705.02, 
709.06. See hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information.
 
Applicant is invited to contact the assigned examining attorney with any questions regarding this 
action. Applicant should have this office action available to refer to when placing a call to the 
examining attorney.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 26, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120674
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the

After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
