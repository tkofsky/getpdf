Applicant:  FactGem, LLC
Reference/Docket No. F0381-5044
Correspondence Email Address:  jreider@buchalter.comNONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues
 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusals - Limited to Specific Services 
•
Advisory regarding Potential Section 2(d) Refusal - Prior-Filed Application 
•
Identification of Services – Amendment Required
•
 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusals - Limited to Specific Services 
 
This partial refusal applies to the following services only: "roviding [sic] on-line non-downloadable 
software used to search, query, analyze, retrieve, monitor, manage, maintain, archive, integrate, 
process, report on, structure, model, present and display content from other computer databases, the 
internet, and other computer systems" and "software; software provider." 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 5917611, 4897340, 4993838, 4404913, 3471017, 5044890, 5214640, and 
5550515. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the 
attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in anylikelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark COLONY in standard characters for “roviding [sic] on-line 
non-downloadable software used to search, query, analyze, retrieve, monitor, manage, maintain, 
archive, integrate, process, report on, structure, model, present and display content from other computer 
databases, the internet, and other computer systems; providing on-line temporary use of non-
downloadable software for creating searchable databases of information and data; providing on-line

arcade-based video game consoles," "electronic game software for wireless devices" and "video game 
software” in International Class 009.

for identifying microorganisms by providing a visual comparator for the microorganisms” in 
International Class 009.

use of non-downloadable software applications for classifieds, virtual public/private online 
communities, networking of like minded users globally, data and media file sharing and transmission of 
photographic images and other media files” in International Class 042.
 
Registrant’s mark is THE KOLONY (Reg. No. 5214640) in standard characters for “Providing on-line 
non-downloadable market research software for analyzing market attitudes and behaviors” in 
International Class 042. 
 
Registrant’s mark is THE KOLONY (Reg. No. 5550515) in stylized text for “Providing on-line non-downloadable market research software for analyzing market attitudes and behaviors” in International 
Class 042. 
 
The bolded marks above are owned by the same registrant. 
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b). 
 
Reg. No. 4404913
 
In a likelihood of confusion determination, the marks in their entireties are compared for similarities in 
appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression. In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 
1323, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1748 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 
746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve 
Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 
2005)); In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 
1973); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v).
 
In the present case, applicant’s mark is COLONY and registrant’s mark is COLONY. These marks are 
identical in appearance, sound, and meaning, “and have the potential to be used . . . in exactly the same 
manner.” In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), aff’d, 866 F.3d 1315, 123 
USPQ2d 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Additionally, because they are identical, these marks are likely to 
engender the same connotation and overall commercial impression when considered in connection with 
applicant’s and registrant’s respective goods and/or services. Id.
 
Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar. 
 
Reg. Nos. 5917611 and 3471017
 
Here, 
applicant’s 
mark, 
COLONY, 
is 
confusingly 
similar 
to 
the 
registered 
marks, 
ADCOLONY and EZCOLONY. 
 
Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of 
terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See 
Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), 
aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 
1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH 
confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM 
and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).In the present case, the applied-for mark, COLONY, appears in both of the registered marks. The 
additional AD- and EZ- in the registered marks are not sufficient to obviate the likelihood of confusion 
between the marks because they are short prefixes that do not diminish the dominance of the term 
COLONY in the marks. Accordingly, the marks are considered similar for likelihood of confusion 
purposes.
 
Reg. Nos. 5214640 and 5550515
 
Here, applicant’s mark, COLONY, is confusingly similar to the registered marks, THE 
KOLONY and THE KOLONY.
 
A mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in any lettering style; the rights reside in the 
wording or other literal element and not in any particular display or rendition. See In re Viterra Inc., 
671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 
1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. §2.52(a); TMEP §1207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a 
mark presented in stylized characters and/or with a design element generally will not avoid likelihood 
of confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters because the word portion could be presented 
in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; 
Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that “the 
argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable where one party asserts rights in no 
particular display”).
 
Therefore, the stylization of the mark in registration number 5550515 does not obviate the likelihood of 
confusion between the marks because the applied-for mark is in standard characters and thus could be 
displayed in any lettering style. 
 
The marks are essentially phonetic equivalents and thus sound similar. Similarity in sound alone may 
be sufficient to support a finding that the compared marks are confusingly similar. In re 1st USA Realty 
Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007) (citing Krim-Ko Corp. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 
390 F.2d 728, 732, 156 USPQ 523, 526 (C.C.P.A. 1968)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iv).
 
COLONY and KOLONY are pronounced the same, therefore the dominant portions of the marks sound 
identical. 
 
Regarding the additional term "THE" in the registered marks, when comparing similar marks, the 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has found that inclusion of the term “the” at the beginning of one of 
the marks will generally not affect or otherwise diminish the overall similarity between the marks. See 
In re Thor Tech Inc., 90 USPQ2d 1634, 1635 (TTAB 2009) (finding WAVE and THE WAVE 
“virtually identical” marks; “[t]he addition of the word ‘The’ at the beginning of the registered mark 
does not have any trademark significance.”); In re Narwood Prods. Inc., 223 USPQ 1034, 1034 (TTAB 
1984) (finding THE MUSIC MAKERS and MUSIC-MAKERS “virtually identical” marks; the 
inclusion of the definite article “the” is “insignificant in determining likelihood of confusion”).
 
Accordingly, the marks are considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.   
                                                                   
 
Reg. Nos. 4993838 and 4404913
 
Here, applicant’s mark, COLONY, is confusingly similar to the registered marks, COLONY42 and COLONY ID.
 
Incorporating the entirety of one mark within another does not obviate the similarity between the 
compared marks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 
2(d). See Wella Corp. v. Cal. Concept Corp., 558 F.2d 1019, 1022, 194 USPQ 419, 422 (C.C.P.A. 
1977) (holding CALIFORNIA CONCEPT and surfer design and CONCEPT confusingly similar); 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106 
(C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL LANCER and design and BENGAL confusingly similar); Double 
Coin Holdings, Ltd. v. Tru Dev., 2019 USPQ2d 377409, at *6-7 (TTAB 2019) (holding ROAD 
WARRIOR and WARRIOR (stylized) confusingly similar); In re Mr. Recipe, LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1084, 
1090 (TTAB 2016) (holding JAWS DEVOUR YOUR HUNGER and JAWS confusingly similar); 
TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii). In the present case, the marks are identical in part.
 
In the present case, the marks are confusingly similar because the applied-for mark is entirely 
incorporated into the registered marks.
 
Additionally,consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any 
trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 
1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between 
VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a 
‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 
Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) 
(finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because 
“consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial 
words is particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”).
 
The first word in the registered marks, COLONY, is identical to the applied-for mark and is likely to be 
noticed first by consumers. Accordingly, the marks are considered similar for likelihood of confusion 
purposes.
 
Reg. No. 5044890
 
Here, applicant’s mark, COLONY, is confusingly similar to the registered mark, COLONITY. 
 
As stated above, marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or 
similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial 
impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 
(TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 
811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and 
COMMUNICASH confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) 
(holding CONFIRM and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 
USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
In the present case, both marks contain the identical term COLON-. This wording appears first in both 
marks and creates a similar overall commercial impression. 
 
Additioanlly, slight differences in the sound of similar marks will not avoid a likelihood of confusion.In re Energy Telecomms. & Elec. Ass’n, 222 USPQ 350, 351 (TTAB 1983); see In re Viterra Inc., 671 
F.3d 1358, 1367, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1912 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
 
COLONY and COLONITY sound very similar when spoken aloud, and the slight difference in sound 
is not enough to obviate the likelihood of confusion between the marks. Accordingly, the marks are 
considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes. 
 
Relatedness of the Goods and/or Services 
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
U.S. Registration Nos. 5917611, 5214640, 4993838, 4404913, 5550515, 3471017 and 5044890
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the application uses broad wording to describe "software; software provider," which 
presumably encompasses all goods and/or services of the type described, including registrants’ more 
narrow:
 
"Communications software for connecting Mobile Device developers and advertisers reach end users; 
Computer application software for mobile phones, namely, software for helping Developers of 
applications and advertisers for use in reaching end users; Computer game software for use on mobile 
and cellular phones; Software development kits (SDK)" (Reg. No. 5917611),
 
"Providing on-line non-downloadable market research software for analyzing market attitudes and 
behaviors" (Reg. No. 5214640), 
 
“Computer game software; computer game software downloadable from a global computer network; 
computer game software for use with personal computers, home video game consoles used with 
televisions and arcade-based video game consoles," "electronic game software for wireless devices" 
and "video game software” (Reg. No. 4993838), 
 
"Computer software for identifying microorganisms by providing a visual comparator for the 
microorganisms" (Reg. No. 4404913),"Providing on-line non-downloadable market research software for analyzing market attitudes and 
behaviors" (Reg. No. 5550515), 
 
"Computer software for management of animal colonies in transgenic and stem cell facilities" (Reg. 
No. 3471017), and 
 
"Providing temporary use of non-downloadable software applications for classifieds, virtual 
public/private online communities, networking of like minded users globally, data and media file 
sharing and transmission of photographic images and other media files" (Reg. No. 5044890). 
 
See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. 
Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and 
services are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) 
(citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 
(C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball 
Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods and/or services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of 
trade, or classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same 
class of purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 
1005 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related. 
 
U.S. Registration No. 4897340 
 
Here, applicant’s services, “roviding [sic] on-line non-downloadable software used to search, query, 
analyze, retrieve, monitor, manage, maintain, archive, integrate, process, report on, structure, model, 
present and display content from other computer databases, the internet, and other computer systems" 
and "software; software provider" are closely related to registrant’s services, “Online social networking 
service provided through global computer networks.” 
 
The 
attached 
Internet 
evidence, 
consisting 
of screenshots 
from Instagram, Twitter, 
and LinkedIn establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the 
relevant services and markets the services under the same mark. Thus, applicant’s and 
registrant’s services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes. See, e.g., In re Davey 
Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 
1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Accordingly, the goods and/or services are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of 
confusion analysis. 
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are similar or identical and the goods and/or services are related or legally identical, 
there is a likelihood of confusion as to the source of applicant’s services, and registration is partially 
refused pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act. 
 
Response Options to RefusalsAlthough applicant’s mark has been partially refused registration, applicant may respond to the 
refusals by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant 
responds to the refusals, applicant must also respond to the requirements set forth below.
 
Advisory regarding Potential Section 2(d) Refusal - Prior-Filed Application 
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 90624411 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
While applicant is not required to respond to the issue of the pending application, applicant must 
respond to the Section 2(d) Refusals above and the  requirement(s) below within the six month deadline 
mentioned above to avoid abandonment.
 
Identification of Services – Amendment Required 
 
The services are classified incorrectly in International Class 041. Applicant must amend the application 
to classify the services in International Class 042. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(7), 2.85; TMEP 
§§1401.02(a), 1401.03(b).  
 
Additionally, the first word in the identification of services, "roviding," appears to be misspelled and 
should be corrected. TMEP §1402.01(a). 
 
Finally, the identification for "software; software provider" in International Class 041 is indefinite and 
too broad and must be clarified because the wording does not make clear the (1) nature or (2) format of 
the software and could identify goods and/or services in three international classes – as a product in 
International Class 9 or a service in International Class 41 or 42. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). Specifically, applicant must indicate the purpose or function of the software, 
and if content- or field-specific, the content or field of use of the software. TMEP §1402.03(d). 
Additionally, applicant must indicate whether the software’s format is downloadable, recorded, or 
online non-downloadable. See id. Downloadable and recorded goods are in International Class 9, 
whereas providing their temporary, online non-downloadable use is a service in International Class 42; 
except for non-downloadable game software provided online or for temporary use, which is in 
International Class 41. See TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a)(xii).
 
The USPTO requires such specificity in order for a trademark examining attorney to examine the 
application properly and make appropriate decisions concerning possible conflicts between the 
applicant’s mark and other marks. See In re N.A.D. Inc., 57 USPQ2d 1872, 1874 (TTAB 2000); TMEP 
§1402.03(d).The following are examples of acceptable identifications in International Class 9: “recorded desktop 
publishing software” and “downloadable mobile applications for managing bank accounts.” 
Additionally, the following are acceptable identifications in International Class 41: “providing online 
non-downloadable game software” and “providing temporary use of non-downloadable game 
software.” Finally, the following are acceptable identifications in International Class 42: “providing 
temporary use of on-line non-downloadable software development tools” and “providing temporary use 
of non-downloadable cloud-based software for calculating energy costs.”
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
International Class 042: Providing on-line non-downloadable software used to search, query, 
analyze, retrieve, monitor, manage, maintain, archive, integrate, process, report on, structure, 
model, present and display content from other computer databases, the internet, and other 
computer systems; providing on-line temporary use of non-downloadable software for creating 
searchable databases of information and data; providing on-line temporary use of non-
downloadable search engine software; computer services, namely, creating for others computer 
network-based indices of information; Providing temporary use of on-line non-downloadable 
software for {specify purpose of software, e.g., creating searchable databases of information 
and data, managing bank accounts, calculating energy costs, etc.}
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand 
the services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e). 
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120892
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
