NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SearchThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Portion of a Title of a Single Work Refusal
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark, as used on the specimen of record, is used only as 
a portion of a title of a single creative work, namely, a portion of a title of a specific book or e-book; it 
does not function as a trademark to identify and distinguish applicant’s goods from those of others and 
to indicate the source of applicant’s goods.  Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-
1052, 1127; see In re Scholastic, Inc., 23 USPQ2d 1774, 1776-79 (TTAB 1992); TMEP §§1202.08, 
1202.08(d); cf. Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1162-63, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 
1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Cooper, 254 F.2d 611, 615-16, 117 USPQ 396, 399-400 (C.C.P.A. 
1958). 
 
In this case, the submitted specimen shows the applied-for mark, SNORKEL MCCORKLE, appearing 
describe location, on a book cover, or in product listings. Such use shows SNORKEL MCCORKLE to 
be the name of the main character in a book titled SNORKEL MCCORKLE AND THE LOST 
FLIPPER. There is no evidence in the application record that applicant’s book/e-book is part of a series 
of creative works, nor are there other specimens or evidence in the record otherwise showing proper 
trademark use of the applied-for mark for the identified goods. While the record includes specimens for 
downloadable music files, the mark is not used in a manner that connotes an indicator of source for the 
downloadable audio goods. Rather, the listings describe the various audio files as theme music for the 
character/book. The downloadable audio files are sold via Etsy through an account titled 
SNORKELMCCORKLEBOOKS, which is different from the applied-for mark.  Overall, consumers 
would view the applied-for mark as a portion of a title of a single work, rather than as a trademark to 
indicate the source of applicant’s goods and to distinguish them from the goods of others. 
 
An applicant may establish that the portion of the title of a creative work is used on a series by 
submitting more than one book cover or e-book cover with the mark used in all the titles. For example, 
if the mark on the drawing is "THE LITTLE ENGINE" and on the book it appears as "THE LITTLE 
ENGINE THAT WENT TO THE FAIR," registration should be refused because the mark is a portion 
of a title of a single work. See In re Nat’l Council Books, Inc., 121 USPQ 198, 199 (TTAB 1959) 
(finding "NATIONAL" to be a portion of the title "NATIONAL GARDEN BOOK"). To establish use 
on a series, the applicant may submit additional book covers showing use of, e.g., "THE LITTLE 
ENGINE GOES TO SCHOOL," and "THE LITTLE ENGINE AND THE BIG RED CABOOSE." 
When a mark is used merely as a portion of the title of a creative work, the applicant has a heavier 
burden in establishing that the portion for which registration is sought serves as a trademark for the 
goods. The mere use of the same words in more than one book title is insufficient to establish the words 
as a mark for a series. The applicant must show that the public perceives the portion sought to be 
registered as a mark for the series. In re Scholastic Inc., 23 USPQ2d 1774, 1777 (TTAB 1992) (holding 
THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS used as a portion of the book titles in "THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS AT 
THE WATERWORKS" and "THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS INSIDE THE EARTH," functions as a 
mark for a series, because the record contained evidence of repeated use of the designation displayed 
prominently on book covers, as well as evidence that applicant promoted THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS 
as a series title, that others used the designation in book reviews to refer to a series of books, and that 
purchasers recognized the designation as indicating the source of a series of books).In appropriate circumstances, applicant may overcome this refusal by satisfying one of the following 
options:
 
(1)   Submit evidence that the applied-for mark (a) is used on a series of creative works, 
(b) creates a separate commercial impression apart from the complete title, and (c) is 
promoted or recognized as a mark for the series. 
 
(2)   Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed). This option will later necessitate 
additional fee(s) and filing requirements.
 
For an overview of these response options and instructions on how to satisfy each option using the 
Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see the Title of a Single Work 
webpage.

your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
