NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.Summary of Issues

Section 2(d) Refusal – Likelihood of Confusion 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 4418177. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.  
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-
by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 
1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 
F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those 
factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in 
every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) 
(quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). 
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 1747 
(quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1380 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 
24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the cumulative 
effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods and differences in the marks.”); TMEP 
§1207.01.
 
Applicant’s applied-for mark is CASTERSHOX in standard characters for “[m]etal casters” in 
International Class 6. 
 
Registrant’s mark is CASTERSHOX in standard characters for “[m]etal casters” in International Class 
6.
 
For the purposes of the Section 2(d) Likelihood of Confusion Refusal, applicant’s mark and the mark in 
U.S. Reg. No. 4418177 are owned by different entities. If applicant owns the registration, applicant 
should reference the ownership of cited registration advisory below. However, applicant is also advised 
that the USPTO does not issue duplicate registrations.
 
In addition, although applicant notes the cited registration is owned by a "sister company," applicant's 
statement is insufficient to establish unity of control. Please see the "unity of control" section below for 
further information. 
 
Similarity of the MarksMarks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
In a likelihood of confusion determination, the marks in their entireties are compared for similarities in 
appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression. In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 
1323, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1748 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 
746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve 
Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 
2005)); In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 
1973); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v).
 
In the present case, applicant’s mark is CASTERSHOX in standard characters  and registrant’s mark is 
CASTERSHOX in standard characters. These marks are identical in appearance, sound, and meaning, 
“and have the potential to be used . . . in exactly the same manner.” In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 
USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), aff’d, 866 F.3d 1315, 123 USPQ2d 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2017). 
Additionally, because they are identical, these marks are likely to engender the same connotation and 
overall commercial impression when considered in connection with applicant’s and registrant’s 
respective goods. Id.
 
Based on the foregoing, the applicant’s applied-for and registrant’s marks are sufficiently similar to 
find a likelihood of confusion.
 
Relatedness of the Goods
 
The goods are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods] emanate from 
the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 
1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 
2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
When analyzing an applicant’s and registrant’s goods for similarity and relatedness, that determination 
is based on the description of the goods services in the application and registration at issue, not on 
extrinsic evidence of actual use. See Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 
1317, 1323, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Octocom Sys. Inc. v. Hous. Computers 
Servs. Inc., 918 F.2d 937, 942, 16 USPQ2d 1783, 1787 (Fed. Cir. 1990)).In this case, the goods in the application and registration are identical. Specifically, applicant and 
registrant provide "[m]etal casters." Therefore, it is presumed that the channels of trade and classes of 
purchasers are the same for these goods. See Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1372, 127 
USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 
1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)).  
 
Based on the analysis above, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are related.
 
Because applicant’s and registrant’s marks are similar and the goods are related, there is a likelihood of 
confusion and applicant’s applied-for mark must be refused under Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Unity of Control Asserted – More Information/Evidence Needed
 
Applicant indicates that it has a legal relationship with the registrant in the cited registration. However, 
a legal relationship between the parties is insufficient to overcome a likelihood of confusion unless the 
parties constitute a “single source.” That is, the legal relationship between the parties must exhibit a 
“unity of control” over the nature and quality of the goods in connection with which the trademarks are 
used, and a “unity of control” over the use of the trademarks. See In re Wella A.G., 5 USPQ2d 1359, 
1361 (TTAB 1987); see also TMEP §1201.07.
 
Unity of control is presumed in instances where, absent contradictory evidence, one party owns (1) all 
of another entity, or (2) substantially all of another entity and asserts control over the activities of that 
other entity. See TMEP §1201.07(b)(i)-(ii). Such ownership is established, for example, when one party 
owns all or substantially all of the stock of another or when one party is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
another. See In re Wella A.G., 5 USPQ2d at 1361; TMEP §1201.07(b)(i)-(ii). It is additionally 
presumed when, absent contradictory evidence, applicant is shown in USPTO records as a joint owner 
of the cited registration, or the owner of the registration is listed as a joint owner of the application, and 
applicant submits a written statement asserting control over the use of the mark by virtue of joint 
ownership. TMEP §1201.07(b)(ii).
 
However, in most other situations, additional evidence is required to show unity of control. For 
example, if the parties are sister corporations or if the parties share certain stockholders, directors or 
officers in common, additional evidence must be provided to show how the parties constitute a single 
source. See In re Pharmacia, Inc., 2 USPQ2d 1883, 1884 (TTAB 1987); TMEP §1201.07(b)(iii).
 
Therefore, applicant must provide a written statement explaining the nature of the legal relationship 
between the parties. In addition, if neither party owns all or substantially all of the other party, and 
USPTO records do not show their joint ownership of the application or cited registration, applicant 
must provide a detailed written explanation and documentary evidence showing the parties’ “unity of 
control” over the nature and quality of the goods in connection with which the trademarks are used, and 
the parties’ “unity of control” over the use of the trademarks. See TMEP §1201.07(b)(i)-(iii). This 
statement and, if necessary, explanation must be verified with an affidavit or signed declaration under 
37 C.F.R. §2.20. TMEP §1201.07(b)(ii)-(iii); see 37 C.F.R. §2.193(e)(1). However, if one party owns 
all of the other entity, and there is no contradictory evidence of record, the written statement need not 
be verified. TMEP §1201.07(b)(i).Advisory: Ownership of Cited Registration
 
If the mark in the cited registration is owned by applicant, applicant may provide evidence of 
ownership of the mark by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1) Record the assignment with the USPTO’s Assignment Recordation Branch (ownership 
transfer documents such as assignments can be filed online at http://etas.uspto.gov) and promptly 
notify the trademark examining attorney that the assignment has been duly recorded;
 
(2) Submit copies of documents evidencing the chain of title; or
 
(3) Submit the following statement, verified with an affidavit or signed declaration under 37 
C.F.R. §2.20: “Applicant is the owner of U.S. Registration No. 4418177.” To provide this 
statement using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS), use the “Response to 
Office Action” form; answer “yes” to wizard questions #3 and #9; then, continuing on to the next 
portion of the form, in the “Additional Statement(s)” section, find “Active Prior Registration(s)” 
and insert the U.S. registration numbers in the data fields; and follow the instructions within the 
form for signing. The form must be signed twice; a signature is required both in the “Declaration 
Signature” section and in the “Response Signature” section.
 
TMEP §812.01; see 15 U.S.C. §1060; 37 C.F.R. §§2.193(e)(1), 3.25, 3.73(a)-(b); TMEP §502.02(a).
 
Recording a document with the Assignment Recordation Branch does not constitute a response to an 
Office action. TMEP §503.01(d).
 
Although applicant may provide evidence of ownership, applicant is advised that the USPTO will not 
issue a duplicate registration. As such, please note the advisory below.
 
Advisory: USPTO Will Not Issue Duplicate Registrations/Express Abandonment by TEAS
 
In the application, applicant states that U.S. Registration No. 4418177 "shall be Expressly Abandoned 
in favor of th[e] present application." However, applicant's miscellaneous statement filed with the 
application does not expressly abandon the registration.
 
In addition, applicant is advised that if applicant establishes ownership of the cited registration, the 
present application will be an exact duplicate of U.S. Registration No. 4418177. 37 C.F.R. §2.48; 
TMEP §703. The USPTO will not issue duplicate registrations. 37 C.F.R. §2.48; TMEP §703.
 
In that event, applicant may abandon the application or surrender the registration (use form #6).
 
Express Abandonment by TEAS
 
Applicant can file a request to expressly abandon the application. See 37 C.F.R. §2.68(a). This will end 
the application process; and the applied-for mark will not register. The request must be properly signed 
by applicant’s attorney, if applicant is represented by an authorized attorney, or by the individual 
applicant, all joint applicants, or someone authorized to sign on behalf of a juristic applicant (e.g., a 
corporate officer or general partner). See 37 C.F.R. §2.193(e)(2); TMEP §§611.03(b), 718.01. Once 
filed, the request may not be withdrawn. 37 C.F.R. §2.68(a).Assistance 
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal in this Office action. See TMEP §§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
