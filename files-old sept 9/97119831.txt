NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office

Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issues below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Mark Description and Color Claim Amendment Required 
I. 
Domicile Clarification Required 
II. 
Disclaimer Required  
III. 
 
 
I.    MARK DESCRIPTION AND COLOR CLAIM AMENDMENT REQUIRED 
 
Applicant must amend the color claim and description to identify all the colors in the drawing of the 
mark. See 37 C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). 
 
A complete color claim must reference all the colors appearing in the drawing of the mark. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1); TMEP §§807.07(a) et seq. Similarly, a complete description of a mark depicted in 
color must specify where the colors appear in the literal and design elements of the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.37, 2.52(b)(1); TMEP §§807.07(a) et seq.
 
PLEASE NOTE: If black, white and/or gray are not a color feature of the mark, applicant must 
provide a statement in the description that black, white and/or gray represent background, outlining,shading and/or transparent areas and are not part of the mark. TMEP §807.07(d).
 
The following color claim and description are suggested, if accurate:
 
If applicant intends to claim color: 
 
Color claim: “The colors black and white are claimed as a feature of the mark.” 
 
Description:  "The mark consists of a black outline of a hexagon with five black slanted lines and 
two black perpendicular lines on either end reminiscent of screw threads.  The inside of the 
hexagon is white.  Below that is the wording "STEPPRO EXPERT" in black.  The remaining 
white represents background and is not claimed as a feature of the mark. 
 
If applicant does not intent to claim color: 
 
Applicant should delete the color claim and use the following mark description: 
 
Description:  "The mark consists of an outline of a hexagon with five slanted lines and two 
perpendicular lines on either end reminiscent of screw threads.  Below that is the wording 
"STEPPRO EXPERT".  
 
 
II.    DOMICILE CLARIFICATION REQUIRED 
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record is for a 
third-party registered agent and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal place of residence or 
principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). A domicile address 
must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an individual 
applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal place of business, 
which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct 
and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
Applications must include an applicant’s domicile address because such domicile determines whether 
an applicant is required to have a U.S.-licensed attorney represent it before the USPTO. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.11(a), 2.32(a)(2); TMEP §§601, 803.05. An applicant whose domicile is located outside of the 
United States or its territories must be represented at the USPTO by an attorney who is an active 
member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a U.S. state or territory. 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); 
TMEP §601.01(a).
 
In this case, the application lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile address 
as follows:  30 N Gould Street, Sheridan, Wyoming 82801. According to the attached webpage 
evidence, this address is for a registered agent and thus does not appear to be applicant’s headquarters 
where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1). A registered agent is a person or entity appointed to accept service of 
process and official mail on behalf of a business.
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide documentation showing that the listed 
U.S. domicile address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile. TMEP §§601.01(b)-(b)(1), 803.05; see 37 C.F.R.§2.11(b).
 
If applicant amends the application to list a domicile street address located outside of the United States 
or its territories, applicant must appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney qualified under 37 C.F.R. §11.14 as its 
representative before the application may proceed to registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); TMEP 
§601.01(a). See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information. However, if applicant 
establishes its domicile street address is located within the United States or its territories, applicant is 
not required to appoint a qualified U.S.-licensed attorney. See TMEP §601.01(b).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to wizard 
question #5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” 
field, uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the 
checkbox provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be 
hidden from public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address 
listed in the “Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support a U.S. domicile address. Applicant should provide the most 
recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for example 
one of the following:  (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar report; or (2) a 
current certificate of good standing for the corporation or other business entity issued by a federal or 
state government agency.  TMEP §601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation 
must show the name, listed domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other 
personal and financial information.
 
To submit the documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to wizard question #3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the 
“Miscellaneous Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support 
the U.S. street address.
 
To appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney in this application, applicant should submit a completed TEAS 
Change Address or Representation form. The newly-appointed attorney must submit a TEAS Response 
to Examining Attorney Office Action form indicating that an appointment of attorney has been made 
and address all other refusals or requirements in this action, if any. Alternatively, if applicant retains an 
attorney before filing the response, the attorney can respond to this Office action by using the 
appropriate TEAS response form and provide his or her attorney information in the form and sign it as 
applicant’s attorney. See 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b)(1)(ii); TMEP §604.01. 
 
 
III.    DISCLAIMER REQUIRED 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “EXPERT” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicants goods and/or services.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from The American Heritage Dictionary shows this wording means "a person 
with a high degree of skill in or knowledge of a certain subject."  Thus, the wording merely describes a 
feature of applicant’s goods in that these goods are superior products because they have been crafted bypeople with skill in this area.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “EXPERT” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
