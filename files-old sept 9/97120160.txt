NONFINAL OFFICE ACTIONThe USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
 
Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.

Advisory regarding Potential Section 2(d) Refusal - Prior-Filed Applications 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting registered marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 
2(d). 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02. However, marks in prior-filed pending applications may 
present a bar to registration of applicant’s mark.
 
The filing dates of pending U.S. Application Serial Nos. 88952216 and 79325369 precede applicant’s 
filing date.  See attached referenced applications.  If one or more of the marks in the referenced 
applications register, applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) 
because of a likelihood of confusion with the registered mark(s).  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, 
action on this application may be suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced 
applications.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the marks in the referenced 
applications.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s 
right to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
While applicant is not required to respond to the issue of the pending application, applicant must 
respond to the refusal(s) and requirement(s) below within the six month deadline mentioned above to 
avoid abandonment.
 
Section 2(e)(1) – Merely Descriptive RefusalRegistration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes an ingredient or quality of 
applicant’s goods and/or services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP 
§§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
Here, applicant has applied to register the mark CULTURE SHOTS for use in connection with 
“Vegetable-based food beverages” in Class 29.   
  
The attached evidence from Collins Dictionary shows that the wording CULTURE means "the growth 
of bacteria, microorganisms, or other plant and animal cells in a specially prepared nourishing fluid or 
solid". The attached evidence from Merriam-Webster shows that the wording SHOT means "a small 
measure or serving (such as one ounce) of undiluted liquor or other beverage." Taken together, the 
combination of the wording CULTURE and SHOTS immediately conveys that applicant's goods are 
small measures or services of beverages that contain bacteria, microorganisms, or other plant and 
animal cells that were grown in a specially prepared nourishing fluid or solid (e.g., shots of beverages 
that are cultured or are prepared using cultures). 
 
Moreover, the attached evidence from applicant's website shows that applicant describes the goods as 
"Probiotics and electrolytes all in one shot. This is a multi-shot 12 oz. bottle.  Drink a shot daily to 
build a stronger gut microbiome," which shows that the wording SHOT is merely descriptive of 
applicant's goods. Additionally, the label of the goods shows that these beverages contain probiotics.  
 
The attached evidence from Farmhouse Culture shows that the "term ‘probiotics’ is often used instead 
of the word ‘live cultures or good and friendly bacteria’." Further, the attached evidence 
from Farmhouse Culture, Pressed, and So Good So You shows that the wording probiotic shots is used 
to describe vegetable-based food beverages that contain cultured probiotics. 
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods and/or services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not 
registrable. In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re 
Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as 
hypodermic, aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 
(TTAB 2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner 
that is an integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services is the combined mark 
registrable. See In re Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial 
Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 
364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
goods and/or services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to 
the goods and/or services. Specifically, the combination of CULTURE and SHOTS does not create a 
new or non-descriptive meaning. Rather, when consumers encounter the mark CULTURE SHOTS they 
will immediately understand that applicant's goods are small servings of beverages (e.g., shots) that 
contain cultured probiotics.
 
Ultimately, when purchasers encounter applicant’s goods using the mark CULTURE SHOTS, they will 
immediately understand the mark as indicating an ingredient or quality of the goods, and not an 
indication that applicant is the source of the goods. Therefore, the mark is merely descriptive, and 
registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act. 
 
Advisory regarding Amendment to Claim Acquired Distinctiveness under Section 2(f) or 
Amendment to the Supplemental Register to Overcome Refusal 
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register. Applicant may respond by 
submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal. In addition, applicant may respond by doing one 
of the following: (1) amending the application to seek registration under Trademark Act Section 2(f), or 
(2) amending the application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. 
§§1052(f), 1091.
 
To seek registration on the Principal Register based on a claim of acquired distinctiveness under 
Section 2(f), applicant generally may (1) submit actual evidence that the mark has acquired 
distinctiveness of the goods and/or services, (2) claim ownership of an active prior U.S. registration for 
the same mark for sufficiently similar goods and/or services, or (3) provide the following verified 
statement of five years’ use: “The mark has become distinctive of the goods and/or services 
through the applicant’s substantially exclusive and continuous use of the mark in commerce that 
the U.S. Congress may lawfully regulate for at least five years immediately before the date of this 
statement.” See 15 U.S.C. §1052(f); 37 C.F.R. §2.41(a); TMEP §§1212.03-.06 et seq.
 
To amend the application to the Supplemental Register, applicant must provide a written statement 
requesting that the application be amended to the Supplemental Register. TMEP §816.01; see 15 
U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §2.47.
 
Although registration on the Supplemental Register does not afford all the benefits of registration on 
the Principal Register, it does provide the following advantages to the registrant:
 
(1)       Use of the registration symbol ® with the registered mark in connection with 
the designated goods and/or services, which provides public notice of the registration and 
potentially deters third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(2)       Inclusion of the registered mark in the USPTO’s database of registered and 
pending marks, which will (a) make it easier for third parties to find it in trademark search 
reports, (b) provide public notice of the registration, and thus (c) potentially deter third 
parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(3)       Use of the registration by a USPTO trademark examining attorney as a bar to 
registering confusingly similar marks in applications filed by third parties.(4)       Use of the registration as a basis to bring suit for trademark infringement in 
federal court, which, although more costly than state court, means judges with more 
trademark experience, often faster adjudications, and the opportunity to seek an injunction, 
actual damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
(5)       Use of the registration as a filing basis for a trademark application for 
registration in certain foreign countries, in accordance with international treaties.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(d), 1091, 1094; J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair 
Competition §§19:33, 19:37 (rev. 4th ed. Supp. 2017).
 
 
NOTE: Amending to the Supplemental Register will not resolve the potential Section 2(d) Refusal(s). 
 
Advisory regarding Disclaimer of Generic Wording if Amending to Claim Acquired 
Distinctiveness under Section 2(f) or to the Supplemental Register
 
Applicant is advised that, if the application is amended to seek registration on the Principal Register 
under Trademark Act Section 2(f) or on the Supplemental Register, applicant will be required to 
disclaim “SHOTS” because such wording appears to be generic in the context of applicant’s goods 
and/or services. See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Wella Corp., 565 F.2d 143, 144, 196 USPQ 7, 8 
(C.C.P.A. 1977); In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 USPQ 766, 768 (TTAB 1986); TMEP 
§1213.03(b).
 
Applicant may submit a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “SHOTS” apart from the mark as shown.
 
TMEP §1213.08(a)(i).
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
 
Response Options to Refusals 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP§§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.
 
Advisory Regarding Hiring a Trademark Attorney
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for 
more information.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120160
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
