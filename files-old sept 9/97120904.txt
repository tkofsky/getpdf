SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION (PARTIAL REFUSAL)
 
THIS PARTIAL REFUSAL APPLIES TO CLASS(ES) 9, 38, 41 and 42 ONLY
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark(s) in 
U.S. Registration No(s). 3833899, 3833900 and 6599789.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registration(s).
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”).  In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.”  In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis:  (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services.  See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01. 
 
COMPARISON OF MARKS
 
The applied-for mark is M+ in a stylized form.
 
The registered marks are:U.S. Reg. No. 3833899, M+ in a standard character form;
1. 
U.S. Reg. No. 3833900, M+ MANAGERPLUS in a stylized form;
2. 
U.S. Reg. No. 6599789, M+ in a stylized form & design.  
3. 
 
Registered marks U.S. Registration No(s). 3833899 and 3833900 are owned by the same registrant.
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.”  
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b).  The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks.  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 
USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 
1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Geigy Chem. Corp. v. Atlas Chem. Indus., Inc., 438 F.2d 1005, 1007, 169 
USPQ 39, 40 (C.C.P.A. 1971)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 (Fed. Cir. 2019); 
TMEP §1207.01(b). 
 
In this case, the compared marks are similar in sound, appearance and commercial impression. The 
compared marks share the identical terms M+. Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where 
similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a 
similar overall commercial impression.  See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 
1987) (finding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 
229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (finding CONFIRM and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re 
Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 1983) (finding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS 
confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii). Consumers could view the applicant’s mark as 
merely a variation of the registrant’s mark and reasonably assume that the applicant’s goods/services 
are a new or additional line of goods/services from the same source as the goods/services provided 
under the registered marks.
 
The applied-for mark and the registered marks U.S. Registration No(s). 3833899 and 6599789  are 
essentially phonetic equivalents and thus sound similar.  Similarity in sound alone may be sufficient to 
support a finding that the compared marks are confusingly similar.  In re 1st USA Realty Prof’ls, Inc., 
84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007) (citing Krim-Ko Corp. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 390 F.2d 728, 
732, 156 USPQ 523, 526 (C.C.P.A. 1968)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iv). 
 
The additional wording U.S. Reg. No. 3833900 in the registered marks does not obviate the similarity 
because the first terms are  M+, on which consumers are more likely to focus on. Consumers aregenerally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any trademark or service mark.  
See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 
73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between VEUVE ROYALE and two 
VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent feature’ as the first 
word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century 
Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding similarity between 
CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because “consumers must first notice th[e] 
identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 
1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial words is particularly significant 
because consumers typically notice those words first”). Thus, this wording is less significant in terms of 
affecting the mark’s commercial impression, and renders the wording M+ the more dominant element 
of the mark.
 
Although applicant’s mark does not contain the entirety of the registered mark U.S. Reg. No. 3833900, 
applicant’s mark is likely to appear to prospective purchasers as a shortened form of registrant’s mark.  
See In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting 
United States Shoe Corp., 229 USPQ 707, 709 (TTAB 1985)).  Thus, merely omitting some of the 
wording from a registered mark may not overcome a likelihood of confusion.  See In re Mighty Leaf 
Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 94 USPQ2d 1257; In re Optica Int’l, 196 USPQ 775, 778 (TTAB 1977); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).  In this case, applicant’s mark does not create a distinct commercial impression 
from the registered mark(s) because it contains some of the wording in the registered mark(s) and does 
not add any wording that would distinguish it from the registered mark(s).
 
In addition, the applied-for mark is entirely incorporated in the registered mark(s) U.S. Reg. No. 
3833900. Incorporating the entirety of one mark within another does not obviate the similarity between 
the compared marks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under 
Section 2(d).  See Wella Corp. v. Cal. Concept Corp., 558 F.2d 1019, 1022, 194 USPQ 419, 422 
(C.C.P.A. 1977) (finding CALIFORNIA CONCEPT and surfer design and CONCEPT confusingly 
similar); Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 
106 (C.C.P.A. 1975) (finding BENGAL LANCER and design and BENGAL confusingly similar); In 
re Integrated Embedded, 120 USPQ2d 1504, 1513 (TTAB 2016) (finding BARR GROUP and BARR 
confusingly similar); In re Mr. Recipe, LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1084, 1090 (TTAB 2016) (finding JAWS 
DEVOUR YOUR HUNGER and JAWS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii).  In the present 
case, the marks are identical in part.
 
When evaluating a composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is normally 
accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be 
remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods and/or services.  In re 
Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii).  Thus, although marks 
must be compared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is 
accorded greater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word 
portion has been disclaimed.  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing 
Giant Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. 
Cir. 1983)).
 
A mark in typed or standard characters, as the registered mark U.S. Reg. No. 3833899 
here, may be displayed in any lettering style; the rights reside in the wording or other literal element 
and not in any particular display or rendition.  See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 
1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. §2.52(a); TMEP §1207.01(c)(iii).  Thus, a mark presented in stylized 
characters and/or with a design element generally will not avoid likelihood of confusion with a mark in 
typed or standard characters because the word portion could be presented in the same manner of 
display.  See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 
697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that “the argument concerning a 
difference in type style is not viable where one party asserts rights in no particular display”). In this 
case, the registered mark may appear in the marketplace in any lettering style, including of the applied-
for mark’s style.
 
Consumers are likely to perceive applicant’s M+ as being affiliated with or originating from the same 
enterprise as goods sold and/or services provided under the registered mark(s) M+ and M+ 
MANAGERPLUS. Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar. 
 
Generally, the greater degree of similarity between the applied-for mark and the registered mark, the 
lesser the degree of similarity between the goods and/or services of the parties is required to support a 
finding of likelihood of confusion.  In re C.H. Hanson Co., 116 USPQ2d 1351, 1353 (TTAB 2015) 
(citing In re Opus One Inc., 60 USPQ2d 1812, 1815 (TTAB 2001)); In re Thor Tech, Inc., 90 USPQ2d 
1634, 1636 (TTAB 2009).

The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668

USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
When analyzing an applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services for similarity and relatedness, that 
determination is based on the description of the goods and/or services in the application and registration 
at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital 
LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1323, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Octocom Sys. Inc. v. 
Hous. Computers Servs. Inc., 918 F.2d 937, 942, 16 USPQ2d 1783, 1787 (Fed. Cir. 1990)).   
 
A. Similarity of goods/services with U.S. Reg. No(s). 3833899, 3833900 
 
In this case, the application use(s) broad wording to describe “Computer programs (downloadable 
software); Computer software (recorded); Computer keyboards”, which presumably encompasses all 
goods and/or services of the type described, including registrant(s)’s more narrow “Computer software 
for business asset management relating to maintenance, depreciation, repair history, identification, 
inventory, condition, valuation, tracking, location, ownership history, and wear-and-tear of physical 
assets and cost analysis related thereto; computer software for asset management, namely, retail 
inventory management; computer software for asset management, namely, customer management, 
namely, providing a summarized view of customer account information, purchase history and 
contact information; computer software for asset management, namely, employee management, 
scheduling and time record keeping”. See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 
1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 
USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110

1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
B. Similarity of goods/services with U.S. Reg. No. 6599789
 
In this case, the goods and/or services in the application and registration(s) identified as "Computer 
aided transmission of messages and images" are identical.  Therefore, it is presumed that the channels 
of trade and class(es) of purchasers are the same for these goods and/or services.  See Cai v. Diamond 
Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1372, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting In re Viterra Inc., 
671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)).    
 
In this case, the application use(s) broad wording to describe "computer programs (downloadable 
software)", "Computer hardware and software consultancy . . . Creating and maintaining web sites 
for others . . . Duplicating computer programs . . . Research and development of new products for 
others . . . Hosting computer sites (websites)", which presumably encompasses all goods and/or 
services of the type described, including registrant(s)’s more narrow "computer game 
programs", "creating, maintaining and hosting electronic websites for others. . . research and 
development services of new products for others . . . duplication of computer programs . . . 
consultancy in the design and development of computer hardware". Likewise, the registration use(s) 
broad wording to describe "transmission of messages. . .  transmission of electronic mail; 
telecommunication . . . providing internet chat rooms", "providing non-downloadable online video 
recordings . . . publishing of on-line electronic publications", which presumably encompasses all 
goods and/or services of the type described, including applicant(s)’s more narrow "Transmission of 
electronic mail; Electronic exchange of messages via . . . chatrooms . . . Telecommunications; 
Transmission of messages and data via wireless digital networks", "Online publication of electronic 
books and periodicals . . . Entertainment services for sharing audio and video recordings". See, e.g., 
In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. 
Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are 
legally identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing 
Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 
(C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball 
Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)). 
 
Additionally, the goods and/or services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of 
trade, or classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same 
class of purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 
1005 (Fed. Cir. 2002)). 
 
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are considered related for likelihood of 
confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); 
In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Where the goods and/or services of an applicant and registrant are “similar in kind and/or closely 
related,” the degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding of likelihood of 
confusion is not as great as in the case of diverse goods and/or services.  In re J.M. Originals Inc., 6 
USPQ2d 1393, 1394 (TTAB 1987); see Shen Mfg. Co. v. Ritz Hotel Ltd., 393 F.3d 1238, 1242, 73 
USPQ2d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2004); TMEP §1207.01(b).SUMMARY 
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or 
services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer.  See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  
Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the 
registrant.  TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
In summary, the applicant’s and registrant’s marks create the same commercial impression and the 
respective goods and/or services are commercially related. Therefore, consumers are likely to be 
confused and mistakenly believe that these goods and/or services originate from a common source. 
Accordingly, registration must be refused under Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES - AMENDMENT REQUIRED (PARTIAL 
REQUIREMENT)
 
THIS PARTIAL REQUIREMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE GOODS AND SERVICES SPECIFIED 
THEREIN
 
Particular wording in the U.S. application’s identification of goods and/or services has been found to 
exceed the scope of the goods and/or services in the foreign registration upon which the U.S. 
application relies. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. For a U.S. application 
based on Trademark Act Section 44(e), an applicant is required to list only goods and/or services that 
are within the scope of the goods and/or services in the foreign registration. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §§1012, 1402.01(b). Therefore, this wording is not considered part of the identification of goods 
and/or services in the U.S. application, and only the remaining wording in the identification is operative 
for purposes of future amendment. See TMEP §1402.01(b); cf. TMEP §1402.07(d).
 
In this case, the U.S. application identifies the particular goods and/or services as follows: "Computer 
operating programs" and 
"Entertainment services for sharing audio and video recordings." However, the foreign registration 
identifies 
the 
following 
goods 
and/or 
services: 
"Computer 
operating 
programs [recorded]" and "Photosharing and video sharing services."
 
These goods and/or services in the U.S. application exceed the scope of the goods and/or services in the 
foreign registration because the goods do not include the limiting wording "[recorded]" and services 
include "sharing audio . . . recordings" instead of "photosharing". Thus, these goods and/or services in 
the U.S. application are not acceptable.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Limiting the identification of goods and/or services in the U.S. application tocorrespond to the goods and/or services in the foreign registration and not exceeding the 
scope of the initial or acceptably amended identification in the U.S. application, and/or 
deleting from the U.S. application all goods and/or services beyond the scope of the 
foreign registration; or
(2)        Substituting a basis under Section 1(a) or 1(b) for those goods and/or services in 
the U.S. application that are beyond the scope of the foreign registration. An applicant may 
assert more than one basis in an application (except Section 1(a) and 1(b) may not be 
asserted for the same goods and/or services), provided all requirements are satisfied for 
each claimed basis.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(a)-(b), 1126; 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(6), 2.34(b), 2.35(b); Marmark Ltd. v. Nutrexpa 
S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845 (TTAB 1989); TMEP §§806.02, 806.03(h), 1402.01(b).
 
Additionally, applicant may respond by arguing that these goods and/or services are within the scope of 
the foreign registration and should remain in the U.S. application.
 
Applicant must clarify the wording "telecommunications" in the identification of goods and/or services 
in International Class(es) 38 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make sufficiently clear what type of 
services encompassed, e.g., telecommunications consultation, telecommunication access services, 
digital network telecommunications services, telecommunications gateway services, etc. Further, this 
wording could identify goods and/or services in more than one international class. For example, 
telecommunications consultation are in International Class 38 and telecommunications technology 
consultancy are in International Class 42.
 
The identification for computer programs in International Class 9 is indefinite and too broad and must 
be clarified to specify whether the format is downloadable, recorded, or online non-downloadable. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). Downloadable and recorded goods are in 
International Class 9, whereas providing their temporary, online non-downloadable use is a service in 
International Class 42. See TMEP §1402.03(d).
 
Applicant must clarify the wording "entertainment services for sharing video recordings" in the 
identification of services in International Class 41, "computer hardware . . . consultancy", "social 
science consultancy", "provision of technical consultancy" in International Class 42, "rehabilitation 
centres", "dental services" in International Class 44 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make 
clear what the specific services are. Further, this wording could identify services in more than one 
international class. For example, the wording "entertainment services for sharing video 
recordings" may 
encompass video-on-demand 
transmission 
services 
in 
International 
Class 
38, providing non-downloadable films via video-on-demand transmission services in International 
Class 41, and providing a web site featuring temporary use of non-downloadable software allowing 
web site users to upload, post and display online videos for sharing with others for entertainment 
purposes in International Class 42.
 
The identification for computer programs/software in International Class 9 is indefinite and must be 
clarified to specify the purpose or function of the software and its content or field of use, if content- or 
field- specific. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). The USPTO requires such 
specificity in order for a trademark examining attorney to examine the application properly and make 
appropriate decisions concerning possible conflicts between the applicant’s mark and other marks. SeeIn re N.A.D. Inc., 57 USPQ2d 1872, 1874 (TTAB 2000); TMEP §1402.03(d).
 
The wording "integrated circuit chips", "compact discs (audio-video)", "data carriers, included in class 
9, computer programs and data collections recorded on the aforesaid data carriers", "digital picture 
frames", "floppy discs", "printers for computers", "cinematographic apparatus", "magnetic tapes", 
"monitors (computer programs)", "optical data carriers", "optical disc", "disc exchangers (for 
computers)", "roentgen films, exposed", "radiology screens for industrial purposes", "providing access 
to computer programs on data networks", "providing access to and transmission of information and 
providing access to online data services and information on the Internet", "electronic exchange of 
messages via chat lines, chatrooms and Internet forums", "news agencies", "providing wireless 
telecommunications connections to global computer networks and other communications networks", 
"transmission of messages and data via wireless digital networks", "arranging and conducting of 
conferences; arranging and conducting of seminars", "providing computer, electronic and online 
databases for educational, recreational and amusement use in the field of entertainment and in the 
fields of secondary, collegiate, social and community interest groups", "publication of electronic 
journals and web logs, featuring user generated or specified content", "digital image processing 
(graphic design)", "computer animation", "scientific reports; technical research", "implementation of 
computer programs on networks; configuring computer networks by means of software", "maintenance 
and installation of software", "research in databases and on the Internet for science and research", 
"out-patient services", "aromatherapy", "pharmacy advice", "public baths; hospices", "services of 
medical institutions for hospital care", "hospitals", "sanitary services . . . and sanatoriums", "medical 
and clinical examinations", "conducting technical project studies", "maintenance of software", 
"computer services, namely, creating virtual communities for registered users to organize groups and 
events, participate in discussions, and engage in social, business and community networking" in the 
identification of goods/services is indefinite and must be clarified because it does not sufficiently 
identify the specific type, function or purpose of goods/services encompassed. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. For example, it is unclear whether the wording "compact discs (audio-
video)" encompasses blank combat discs or compact discs featuring music, etc. Similarly, the 
wording "floppy discs"  is indefinite because descriptions of floppy computer discs must indicate that 
the goods are blank, if accurate, and descriptions of recorded floppy computer discs must indicate the 
function of the recorded software programs.
 
The identification of goods and/or services contains parentheses and brackets. Generally, an applicant 
should not use parentheses and brackets, including curly brackets, in identifications in order to avoid 
confusion with the USPTO’s practice of using parentheses and brackets in registrations to indicate (1) 
goods and/or services that have been deleted from registrations, (2) goods and/or services not claimed 
in an affidavit of incontestability, or (3) guidance to users of the USPTO’s U.S. Acceptable 
Identification of Goods and Services Manual to draft an acceptable identification. See TMEP 
§§1402.04, 1402.12. The only exception for including parenthetical information in identifications is if 
it serves to explain or translate the matter immediately preceding the parenthetical phrase in such a way 
that it does not affect the clarity or scope of the identification, e.g., “fried tofu pieces (abura-age).” See 
TMEP §1402.12. Therefore, applicant must remove the parentheses and brackets from the 
identification and incorporate any parenthetical or bracketed information into the description of the 
goods and/or services.
 
Applicant is advised to delete or modify the duplicate entry in the identification of goods in 
International Class 9 for “computers" and services in International Class 38 for "transmission of 
electronic mail" and International Class 42 for "computer programming". See generally TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.01(a). If applicant does not respond to this issue, be advised that the USPTO willremove duplicate entries from the identification prior to registration.  If modifying one of the duplicate 
entries, applicant may amend it to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden or 
expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Also, generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not 
later be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).

Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the U.S. application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found in or encompassed by those in the original U.S. 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e). Additionally, for U.S. 
applications filed under Trademark Act Section 44(e), the scope of the identification for purposes of 
permissible amendments may not exceed the scope of the goods and/or services identified in the 
foreign registration.  37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); Marmark, Ltd. v. Nutrexpa, S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845 
(TTAB 1989) (citing In re Löwenbräu München, 175 USPQ 178, 181 (TTAB 1972)); TMEP §§1012, 
1402.01(b).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 44:
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that 
are classified in at least EIGHT classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 
FIVE class(es).  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the 
submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already 
paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 44 multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
MARK DESCRIPTION - AMENDMENT REQUIRED
 
When an applicant submits a drawing showing the mark in color, applicant’s color claim and 
description must reference all the colors in the mark, including black, white and/or gray. TMEP 
§807.07(d); see 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 2.52(b)(1). If black, white and/or gray are not a color feature of the 
mark, applicant must provide a statement in the description that black, white and/or gray represent 
background, outlining, shading and/or transparent areas and are not part of the mark. TMEP 
§807.07(d).
 
The following format is suggested:
 
Color claim: "The colors blue, light blue and white are claimed as a feature of the 
mark."
 
Description: "The mark consists of the stylized dark blue and white capsule 
overlapping a larger stylized light blue and white capsule in the shape of a checkmark 
at the center of a square with rounded edges representing a numberless clock face 
with blue dashes in place of numbers. All other instances of the color white represent 
background, outlining, shading, and/or transparent areas and are not part of the 
mark."
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§807.07(d) et seq.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120904
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
