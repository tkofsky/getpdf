Likelihood of Confusion: 
 
The applicant applied to register the mark: THE PEACES COLLECTIVE for business services, 
namely, combined strategic goods or services sourcing and cooperative purchasing for others in Int. 
Class 35. 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration No(s). 5605010; 5605009; 5593002 for THEPIECECOLLECTIVE, with and 
without design, same owner, for clothing in Int. class 25 and for a retail store services featuring 
clothing, accessories, home goods, home décor and gift items in Int. class 35.  
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached 
registrations. 
 
Similarities in Appearance, Sound, Connotation and Commercial Impression: 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
THE PEACES COLLECTIVE vs.  THEPIECECOLLECTIVE, with and without design
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant: similarity of the marks, similarity and nature of 
the goods and/or services, and similarity of the trade channels of the goods and/or services.  See In reViterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Dakin’s 
Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d 1593, 1595-96 (TTAB 1999); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
The applicant features the mark THE PEACES COLLECTIVE and the registrant(s) features the 
mark(s) THEPIECECOLLECTIVE. The marks are the same in that both feature the words THE and 
COLLECTIVE in the same positions. Additionally, the marks are essentially phonetic equivalents as to 
the words PIECE and PEACES and thus sound similar. Similarity in sound alone may be sufficient to 
support a finding that the compared marks are confusingly similar. In re 1st USA Realty Prof’ls, Inc., 
84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007) (citing Krim-Ko Corp. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 390 F.2d 728, 
732, 156 USPQ 523, 526 (C.C.P.A. 1968)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iv). Based on those similarities the 
marks could easily be confused. 
 
An applied-for mark that is the singular or plural form of a registered mark is essentially identical in 
sound, appearance, meaning, and commercial impression, and thus the marks are confusingly similar. 
Swiss Grill Ltd., v. Wolf Steel Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 2001, 2011 n.17 (TTAB 2015) (holding “it is obvious 
that the virtually identical marks [the singular and plural of SWISS GRILL] are confusingly similar”); 
Weider Publ’ns, LLC v. D & D Beauty Care Co., 109 USPQ2d 1347, 1355 (TTAB 2014) (finding the 
singular and plural forms of SHAPE to be essentially the same mark) (citing Wilson v. Delaunay, 245 
F.2d 877, 878, 114 USPQ 339, 341 (C.C.P.A. 1957) (finding no material difference between the 
singular and plural forms of ZOMBIE such that the marks were considered the same mark).
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.” 
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When evaluating a composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is normally 
accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be 
remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods and/or services. In re 
Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks 
must be compared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is 
accorded greater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word 
portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant 
Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 
1983)).
 
The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who retains a general rather than 
specific impression of trademarks. In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 
2020) (citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 (TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. 
John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP §1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 
774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 2014).
 
Services: 
 
The applicant features business services, namely, combined strategic goods or services sourcing and 
cooperative purchasing for others in Int. Class 35, however, the specimen provided appears to showthat the applicant is in fact providing retail services. The registrant features clothing in Int. class 25 and 
for a retail store services featuring clothing, accessories, home goods, home décor and gift items in Int. 
class 35.  
 
Where the goods and/or services of an applicant and registrant are “similar in kind and/or closely 
related,” the degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding of likelihood of 
confusion is not as great as in the case of diverse goods and/or services.  In re J.M. Originals Inc., 6 
USPQ2d 1393, 1394 (TTAB 1987); see Shen Mfg. Co. v. Ritz Hotel Ltd., 393 F.3d 1238, 1242, 73 
USPQ2d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2004); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Please provide a further explanation as to what services applicant is providing. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Other Informalities:
 
If applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below.
 
Disclaimer:
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “COLLECTIVE” because it is merely descriptive of an 
ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or 
services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from Bing shows this wording refers to collective body.  Thus, the wording 
merely describes applicant’s services because the applicant features a grouping of people who work 
together or a specific purpose.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “COLLECTIVE” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire mark. 
See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1041, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005); TMEP 
§1213.01(b).
 
Specimens: 
 
Specimen does not show direct association between mark and services.
 
Registration is refused because the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and fails to show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the identified 
services in International Class(es) 35. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (b)(2); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(f)(ii), (g)(i). An application 
based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as 
actually used in commerce for each international class of services identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a).
 
When determining whether a mark is used in connection with the services in the application, a key 
consideration is the perception of the user. In re JobDiva, Inc., 843 F.3d 936, 942, 121 USPQ2d 1122, 
1126 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., 686 F.3d 1376, 1381-82, 103 
USPQ2d 1672, 1676 (Fed Cir. 2012)). A specimen must show the mark used in a way that would create 
in the minds of potential consumers a sufficient nexus or direct association between the mark and the 
services being offered. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2); In re Universal Oil Prods. Co., 476 F.2d 653, 655, 
177 USPQ2d 456, 457 (C.C.P.A. 1973); TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii).
 
To show a direct association, specimens consisting of advertising or promotional materials must (1) 
explicitly reference the services and (2) show the mark used to identify the services and their source. In 
re The Cardio Grp., LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 227232, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re WAY Media, 
LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1697, 1698 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii). Although the exact nature of the 
services does not need to be specified in the specimen, there must be something that creates in the mind 
of the purchaser an association between the mark and the services. In re Adair, 45 USPQ2d 1211, 1215 
(TTAB 1997) (quoting In re Johnson Controls Inc., 33 USPQ2d 1318, 1320 (TTAB 1994)).
 
In the present case, the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and services in 
that it only appears to show a retail service. The specimen does not show the combined strategic goods 
or services sourcing and cooperative purchasing for others. The specimen states "fall in love with 
handmade style, flat rate 6.95 shipping, free shipping on orders of $55 or more. The specimen also 
mentions SHOPPING and therefore, the specimen appears to show a retail service.  
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).  Any webpage printout or 
screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or 
printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified 
statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); 
TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1) Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the 
filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for 
the services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified substitute 
specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in a signed 
affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or new, or 
originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as 
early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to allege 
use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.(2) Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
