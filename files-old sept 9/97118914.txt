NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Likelihood of Confusion
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 6741565. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
In this case, the services are closely related and overlapping.  The applicant's services are "Restaurant; 
Café; Cocktail lounges; Coffee bars; Ice cream parlors; Juice bar services."  The registrant's services 
include "Services for providing food and drink, namely, restaurant and catering services; bar services; 
catering."  Both the applicant's services and the registrant's services include restaurant and bar services.
 
Where the goods and/or services of an applicant and registrant are “similar in kind and/or closely 
related,” the degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding of likelihood of 
confusion is not as great as in the case of diverse goods and/or services.  In re J.M. Originals Inc., 6 
USPQ2d 1393, 1394 (TTAB 1987); see Shen Mfg. Co. v. Ritz Hotel Ltd., 393 F.3d 1238, 1242, 73 
USPQ2d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2004); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
In this case, the applied-for mark, RASPUTIN, is highly similar to the registrant's mark, 
RASPOUTINE, and design.  Both marks begin with the letters RASP and include the letters UTIN.  
The applied-for mark is similar to the word portion of the registrant's mark in appearance, sound, 
meaning and overall commercial impression.  
 
The word portions of the marks are similar in appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial 
impression; therefore, the addition of a design element does not obviate the similarity of the marks in 
this case.  See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1206, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1688 (Fed. Cir. 1993); 
TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii).Under the doctrine of foreign equivalents, a mark in a common, modern foreign language and a mark 
that is its English equivalent may be held confusingly similar. TMEP §1207.01(b)(vi); see, e.g., In re 
Aquamar, Inc., 115 USPQ2d 1122, 1127-28 (TTAB 2015); In re Thomas, 79 USPQ2d 1021, 1025 
(TTAB 2006). Consequently, marks comprised of foreign wording are translated into English to 
determine similarity in meaning and connotation with English word marks. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. 
Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1377, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1696 
(Fed. Cir. 2005). Equivalence in meaning and connotation may be sufficient to find such marks 
confusingly similar. See In re Aquamar, Inc., 115 USPQ2d at 1127-28; In re Thomas, 79 USPQ2d at 
1025.
 
Registrant's mark is in French, which is a common, modern language in the United States. See In re 
Optica Int’l, 196 USPQ 775 (TTAB 1977).
 
The doctrine is applied when “the ordinary American purchaser” would “stop and translate” the foreign 
term into its English equivalent. Palm Bay, 396 F.3d at 1377, 73 USPQ2d at 1696 (quoting In re Pan 
Tex Hotel Corp., 190 USPQ 109, 110 (TTAB 1976)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(vi)(A). The ordinary 
American purchaser includes those proficient in the foreign language. In re Spirits Int’l, N.V., 563 F.3d 
1347, 1352, 90 USPQ2d 1489, 1492 (Fed. Cir. 2009); see In re Thomas, 79 USPQ2d at 1024.
 
In this case, the ordinary American purchaser would likely stop and translate the mark because the 
French language is a common, modern language spoken by an appreciable number of consumers in the 
United States.  
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or 
services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer. See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the 
registrant. TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
In this case, since the services are closely related and overlapping and the marks are confusingly 
similar, there is a substantial likelihood of confusion as to the source of the goods.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Translation
 
Applicant’s English translation of RASPUTIN in the application is unnecessary because this term 
appears in an English dictionary. TMEP §809.01(b)(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(9). The USPTO will 
disregard the translation; it will not be published on any registration certificate that may issue from this 
application. TMEP §809.03.

have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
