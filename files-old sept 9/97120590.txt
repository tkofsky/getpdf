Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Section 2(e)(1) – Merely Descriptive Refusal 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature, characteristic, purpose, 
function, or intended audience of applicant’s services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
Here, applicant has applied to register the mark EFUNDING EXPERTS for use in connection with 
“business loan broker” in Class 36.   
 
According to the attached evidence, the letter “e” used as a prefix has become commonly recognized as 
a designation for goods and/or services that are electronic in nature or are sold or provided 
electronically. Specifically, the evidence consists of dictionary definitions which shows that the "e" 
prefix means electronic.When a mark consists of the “e” prefix coupled with a descriptive word or term for electronic goods 
and/or services, then the entire mark may be considered merely descriptive under Trademark Act 
Section 2(e)(1). See In re SPX Corp., 63 USPQ2d 1592 (TTAB 2002) (holding E-
AUTODIAGNOSTICS merely descriptive of an electronic engine analysis system comprised of a 
hand-held computer and related computer software); In re Styleclick.com Inc., 57 USPQ2d 1445 
(TTAB 2000) (holding E FASHION merely descriptive of software for consumer use in shopping via a 
global computer network and of electronic retailing services); TMEP §1209.03(d). 
 
FUNDING, meaning, "the act of raising capital to conduct an activity" is descriptive because it merely 
describes a purpose of applicant's services in that applicant helps consumers raising capital to conduct 
business activities. See the attached definition from The Free Dictionary. Also see the attached 
evidence from third party websites explaining the services provided by a loan broker.  
 
EXPERTS, meaning, "one with the special skill or knowledge representing mastery of a particular 
subject" is descriptive because it merely describes applicant as one with the special skill or knowledge 
representing 
mastery 
of business 
loan 
funding. See the 
attached 
definition 
from Merriam-
Webster Dictionary.
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods and/or services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not 
registrable. In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re 
Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as 
hypodermic, aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 
(TTAB 2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner 
that is an integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services is the combined mark 
registrable. See In re Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial 
Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 
364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods 
and/or services. Specifically, EFUNDING EXPERTS immediately informs consumers that applicant 
is one with the special skill or knowledge representing mastery of electronically raising capital to 
conduct business activities. Thus, because applicant's services encompasses business loan brokerage 
services, the combination of the terms does not create a new non-descriptive meaning and the mark 
remains merely descriptive as individual components and as a whole.  
 
Ultimately, when purchasers encounter applicant's services using the mark, EFUNDING EXPERTS, 
they will immediately understand the mark as indicating a feature, characteristic or purpose of 
the services, and not an indication that applicant is the source of the services. Therefore, the mark is 
merely descriptive, and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act.  
 
Advisory regarding Amendment to Claim Acquired Distinctiveness under Section 2(f) orAmendment to the Supplemental Register to Overcome Refusal 
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register. Applicant may respond by 
submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal. In addition, applicant may respond by doing one 
of the following: (1) amending the application to seek registration under Trademark Act Section 2(f), or 
(2) amending the application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. 
§§1052(f), 1091.
 
To seek registration on the Principal Register based on a claim of acquired distinctiveness under 
Section 2(f), applicant generally may (1) submit actual evidence that the mark has acquired 
distinctiveness of the goods and/or services, (2) claim ownership of an active prior U.S. registration for 
the same mark for sufficiently similar goods and/or services, or (3) provide the following verified 
statement of five years’ use: “The mark has become distinctive of the goods and/or services 
through the applicant’s substantially exclusive and continuous use of the mark in commerce that 
the U.S. Congress may lawfully regulate for at least five years immediately before the date of this 
statement.” See 15 U.S.C. §1052(f); 37 C.F.R. §2.41(a); TMEP §§1212.03-.06 et seq.
 
To amend the application to the Supplemental Register, applicant must provide a written statement 
requesting that the application be amended to the Supplemental Register. TMEP §816.01; see 15 
U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §2.47.
 
Although registration on the Supplemental Register does not afford all the benefits of registration on 
the Principal Register, it does provide the following advantages to the registrant:
 
(1)       Use of the registration symbol ® with the registered mark in connection with 
the designated goods and/or services, which provides public notice of the registration and 
potentially deters third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(2)       Inclusion of the registered mark in the USPTO’s database of registered and 
pending marks, which will (a) make it easier for third parties to find it in trademark search 
reports, (b) provide public notice of the registration, and thus (c) potentially deter third 
parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(3)       Use of the registration by a USPTO trademark examining attorney as a bar to 
registering confusingly similar marks in applications filed by third parties.
 
(4)       Use of the registration as a basis to bring suit for trademark infringement in 
federal court, which, although more costly than state court, means judges with more 
trademark experience, often faster adjudications, and the opportunity to seek an injunction, 
actual damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
(5)       Use of the registration as a filing basis for a trademark application for 
registration in certain foreign countries, in accordance with international treaties.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(d), 1091, 1094; J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair 
Competition §§19:33, 19:37 (rev. 4th ed. Supp. 2017).
 
Sections 1, 2, 3 and 45 - Failure to Function RefusalThis refusal applies to the wording "efundingexperts.com" as it appears in the URL and email 
address portions on the specimen.  
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark, as used on the specimen of record, does not 
function as a service mark to identify and distinguish applicant’s services from those of others and to 
indicate the source of applicant’s services. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, 3, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-
1053, 1127; see In re The Ride, LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 39644, at *6 (TTAB 2020); In re Keep A Breast 
Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1879-80 (TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904.07(b), 1301.02.
 
While the trademark examining attorney notes that the entire mark does appear in the URL and email 
address portions of the specimen, it does not match the mark drawing because it is not separable from 
the rest of the wording (i.e., .com). Furthermore, it fails to function because it is buried inside 
informational non-source identifying text on the website. 
 
Response Options to Refusals 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
Substitute Specimen Required
 
Mark shown on drawing does not match mark on specimen. Registration is refused because the 
specimen does not show the mark in the drawing in use in commerce in International Class 36, which is 
required in the application or amendment to allege use. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). The mark 
appearing on the specimen and in the drawing must match; that is, the mark in the drawing “must be a 
substantially exact representation of the mark” on the specimen. See 37 C.F.R. §2.51(a)-(b); TMEP 
§807.12(a).
 
In this case, the specimen displays the mark as E ENTREPRENEUR FUNDING EXPERTS. However, 
the drawing displays the mark as EFUNDING EXPERTS. The mark on the specimen and in the 
drawing do not match because the mark on the drawing is only a portion of the mark appearing on the 
specimen.
 
A portion of a mark may be registered only “if that portion presents a separate and distinct commercial 
impression.” In re Lorillard Licensing Co., 99 USPQ2d 1312, 1316 (TTAB 2011) (citing In re 1175854 
Ontario Ltd., 81 USPQ2d 1446, 1448 (TTAB 2006)). In this case, the drawing shows only a 
nonseparable part of the mark appearing on the specimen. See In re Chem. Dynamics Inc., 839 F.2d 
1569, 1571, 5 USPQ2d 1828, 1829-30 (Fed. Cir. 1988); In re Guitar Straps Online LLC, 103 USPQ2d 
1745, 1751 (TTAB 2012); TMEP §807.12(a), (d). Specifically, the specimen shows the word 
ENTREPRENUER added to the mark and this wording creates a separate and distinct commercial 
impression from the mark drawing which only shows the wording as EFUNDING EXPERTS. 
Applicant has thus failed to provide the required evidence of use of the mark in commerce. See TMEP 
§807.12(a).
 
Furthermore, the specimen also displays the mark as ENTREPRENEUR FUNDING EXPERTS. 
However, the drawing displays the mark as EFUNDING EXPERTS. The mark on the specimen does 
not match the mark in the drawing because the mark on the specimen is missing the "E" that iscurrently in the mark drawing, EFUNDING EXPERTS, and the specimen inserts the word 
ENTREPRENEUR. Applicant has thus failed to provide the required evidence of use of the mark in 
commerce. See TMEP §807.12(a).
 
Specimen does not show direct association between mark and services. Registration is refused 
because the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and the services and fails to 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the identified services in International 
Class 36. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 
2.56(a), (b)(2); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(f)(ii), (g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for 
each international class of services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. 
§1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
When determining whether a mark is used in connection with the services in the application, a key 
consideration is the perception of the user. In re JobDiva, Inc., 843 F.3d 936, 942, 121 USPQ2d 1122, 
1126 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., 686 F.3d 1376, 1381-82, 103 
USPQ2d 1672, 1676 (Fed Cir. 2012)). A specimen must show the mark used in a way that would create 
in the minds of potential consumers a sufficient nexus or direct association between the mark and the 
services being offered. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2); In re Universal Oil Prods. Co., 476 F.2d 653, 655, 
177 USPQ2d 456, 457 (C.C.P.A. 1973); TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii).
 
To show a direct association, specimens consisting of advertising or promotional materials must (1) 
explicitly reference the services and (2) show the mark used to identify the services and their source. In 
re The Cardio Grp., LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 227232, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re WAY Media, 
LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1697, 1698 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii). Although the exact nature of the 
services does not need to be specified in the specimen, there must be something that creates in the mind 
of the purchaser an association between the mark and the services. In re Adair, 45 USPQ2d 1211, 1215 
(TTAB 1997) (quoting In re Johnson Controls Inc., 33 USPQ2d 1318, 1320 (TTAB 1994)).
 
To show a direct association, specimens showing the mark used in rendering the identified services 
need not explicitly refer to those services, but “there must be something which creates in the mind of 
the purchaser an association between the mark and the service activity.” In re The Cardio Grp., LLC, 
2019 USPQ2d 227232, at *1 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re WAY Media, LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1697, 1698 
(TTAB 2016)).
 
In the present case, the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and services in 
that there is no indication that applicant is a business loan broker or provides business loan brokerage 
services. Specifically, the specimen demonstrates that EFUNDING EXPERTS is a lender as the 
specimen provides "the #1 lending source for entrepreneurs". However, applicant applied for "business 
loan broker" services. The attached evidence demonstrates the differences between a loan lender and a 
loan broker. Thus, applicant must submit a substitute specimen showing use of the mark, EFUNDING 
EXPERTS, in commerce in connection with business loan brokerage services. 
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commercefor the services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association 
between the mark and the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing 
material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the 
mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); 
TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).  Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a 
specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the 
specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement 
under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a). 
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Identification of Services – Amendment Required 
 
The identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because the applicant must specify the 
services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
International Class 36: Business loan brokerage services
•
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).  
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
