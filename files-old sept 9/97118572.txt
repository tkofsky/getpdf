The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date

System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues: 
Requirement - Identification of Goods / Recitation of Services
•
Requirement - Insufficient Fees
•
Requirement - Translation
•
 
1.  Advisory - Search for References DEFERRED: 
The trademark examining attorney will defer a search of the USPTO database of registered and pending 
marks for potentially conflicting marks until applicant responds to the issues raised in this Office 
action. TMEP §704.02.
 
2.  Requirement - Identification of Goods / Recitation of Services: 
A written application must specify the particular goods and/or services on or in connection with which 
the applicant uses, or has a bona fide intention to use, the mark in commerce.  15 U.S.C. §§1051(a)(2)  
and 1051(b)(2); 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6).  To "specify" means to name in an explicit manner.  The 
identification should set forth common names, using terminology that is generally understood.  The 
identification of goods and/or services must be specific, definite, clear, accurate, and concise.   See In 
re Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 1 USPQ2d 1296 (TTAB 1986) , rev’d on other 
grounds, 824 F.2d 957, 3 USPQ2d 1450 (Fed. Cir. 1987); The Procter & Gamble Co. v. Economics 
Laboratory, Inc., 175 USPQ 505 (TTAB 1972), modified without opinion, 498 F.2d 1406, 181 USPQ 
722 (C.C.P.A. 1974); In re Cardinal Laboratories, Inc., 149 USPQ 709 (TTAB 1966) ; California 
Spray-Chemical Corp. v. Osmose Wood Preserving Co. of America, Inc., 102 USPQ 321 (Comm’r 
Pats. 1954); Ex parte The A.C. Gilbert Co., 99 USPQ 344 (Comm’r Pats. 1953).  TMEP §1402.01. 
 
As to International Class 001: 
The wording “Diagnostic reagents and diagnostic reagents for analytical, scientific and industrial use” 
in the identification of goods for International Class 001 must be clarified because it is unclear what 
goods the applicant is providing. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. Specifically, 
the wording "diagnostic reagents" is repeated in the identification.  Please delete the duplicate wording 
for the record.  Additionally, this clause is written broadly enough to be for a medical purpose.  Please 
note that diagnostic reagents for medical use are properly classified in Class 005. Specifically, the 
wording "analytical" is unclear.  Applicant may state, "Diagnostic reagents for analytical, scientific 
and industrial use, except for medical or veterinary use" in Class 001, if accurate.
 
As to International Classes 009 and 042: 
The wording “Downloadable or non-downloadable software” in the identification of goods and 
recitation of services in Classes 009 and 042 must be clarified because it is too broad and could include 
goods and/or services in other international classes. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 
1402.03. Specifically, software that is downloadable is properly classified in Class 009.  If applicant is 
providing temporary use of on-line non-downloadable software, these services are properly classified in 
Class 042.  For both forms of software, applicant must provide the purpose or function of the software 
and its content or field of use, if content- or field- specific.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). The USPTO requires such specificity in order for a trademark examining 
attorney to examine the application properly and make appropriate decisions concerning possible 
conflicts between the applicant’s mark and other marks. See In re N.A.D. Inc., 57 USPQ2d 1872, 1874 
(TTAB 2000); TMEP §1402.03(d).
 
As to International Class 009:The wording “imaging devices” in the identification of goods for International Class 009 must be 
clarified because it is too broad and could include goods in other international classes. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.  For example, "imaging apparatus for the study of proteins for 
agricultural purposes" are properly classified in Class 009, however, the wording "medical imaging 
apparatus" is properly classified in Class 010.  Please clarify the wording "imaging devices" for the 
record and classify appropriately. 
 
The wording “imaging devices and related software, peripherals and accessories” in the identification 
of goods for International Class 009 must be clarified because it is too broad and could include goods in 
other international classes. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.  Specifically, as 
discussed above, the wording "Imaging devices" is not acceptable.  The wording "related software, 
peripherals and accessories" is also unacceptable.  Specifically, applicant must identify the format of 
the software as well as the function or purpose of the software and classify the software appropriately.  
Additionally, applicant must identify the peripherals and accessories by common commercial or 
generic name and classify appropriately.  
 
As to International Class 010: 
The wording “medical imaging devices” in the identification of goods for International Class 010 must 
be clarified. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. Specifically, for proper 
classification in Class 010, applicant may state, "medical imaging apparatus" if accurate.
 
The wording “medical imaging devices and related software, peripherals and accessories.” in the 
identification of goods for International Class 010 must be clarified because it is too broad and could 
include goods in other international classes. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 
1402.03.  Specifically, the wording "medical imaging devices" is indefinite.  However, applicant may 
state, "medical imaging apparatus" in Class 010, if accurate.  Additionally, the wording "related 
software, peripherals and accessories" is also unacceptable.  Specifically, applicant must identify the 
format of the software as well as the function or purpose of the software and classify the software 
appropriately.  Additionally, applicant must identify the peripherals and accessories by common 
commercial or generic name and classify appropriately. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:  
International Class 001:
Diagnostic reagents for analytical, scientific and industrial use, except for medical or veterinary use; 
Diagnostic reagents and preparations, except for medical or veterinary use; Diagnostic reagents for 
scientific or research use.
 
International Class 005:
Diagnostic reagents for medical use; chemical reagents for medical diagnosis and analysis.
 
International Class 009:
Downloadable software for {please provide the function or purpose of the software, e.g., for 
processing images, graphics and text; for downloading and organizing music files; for 
authenticating user identification, etc.}; imaging apparatus for the study of proteins for 
agricultural purposes; imaging apparatus for the study of proteins for agricultural purposes and 
related 
software, 
namely, 
downloadable 
software 
for 
processing 
digital 
images, 
computer peripherals and accessories, namely, {please identify the accessories by common 
commercial or generic name}; Downloadable software for operating medical imaging apparatus.International Class 010:
Medical apparatus and instrument for diagnostic use, namely, apparatus for medical diagnostic testing 
in the fields of cancer or other tissue-based diagnostic testing, cytology and cell-based testing; medical 
imaging apparatus. 
 
International Class 042:
Providing temporary use of online non-downloadable software for {please provide the function or 
purpose of the software, e.g., for processing images, graphics and text; for downloading and 
organizing music files; for authenticating user identification, etc.}. 
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
3.  Requirement - Insufficient Fee: 
The application identifies goods and/or services that are classified in at least five classes; however, 
applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only one class. In a multiple-class application, a fee for each 
class is required. 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a)(2), (b)(2); TMEP §§810.01, 1403.01. For more information about 
adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
Therefore, applicant must either (1) restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees 
already paid, or (2) submit the fees for each additional class.
 
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.
 
4.  Requirement - Translation: 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must submit an English translation of the 
foreign wording in the mark. 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(9), 2.61(b); see TMEP §809.
 
     The following is suggested: The English translation of “MOSAICA” in the mark is “MOSAIC”.
 
TMEP §809.03. See attached translation evidence. To respond to this requirement for information, 
open the appropriate Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form and enter the 
serial number, answer “yes” to question 3, and provide the information on the “Additional 
Statement(s)” page in the “Translation” text box(es) in the form.Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).

on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118572
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.

(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
