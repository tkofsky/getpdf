COMBINED EXAMINER’S AMENDMENT/PRIORITY ACTION 
NONFINAL OFFICE ACTIONThe USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
PRIORITY ACTION
 
USPTO database searched; no conflicting marks found.  The trademark examining attorney has 
searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and has found no conflicting marks that 
would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.  
 
Applicant must address issues shown below.  On August 24, 2022, the examining attorney and 
applicant's attorney Jonathan B. Soike discussed the issues below.  Applicant must timely respond to 
these issues.  See 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §2.62(a); TMEP §708.05.  
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Disclaimer Required
•
Advisory: Partial Abandonment
•
 
 
Disclaimer Required
This requirement applies only to International Class 31.
 
As indicated below, the applicant has authorized a disclaimer of the term "ETHANOL" for 
International Class 4. However, the applicant must also disclaim the wording “CARDINAL” in 
International Class 31 because it is merely descriptive of a characteristic of the applicant’s goods.  See 
15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 
103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The Oxford University Press defines "CARDINAL" as a songbird that is partly or mostly red in color 
("Exhibit A"). In the context of the applicant's goods, this describes a characteristic thereof, namely, the 
feed is not limited to a particular category of animals, which therefore is presumed to include birds, 
such as cardinals. The descriptive nature of the term is further demonstrated by the attached evidence 
from producers and retailers of feed and websites featuring information thereabout, which use the term 
"CARDINAL" to indicate the feed and vegetable oils are intended for consumption by a particular 
category of songbirds ("Exhibit B"). Thus, this term merely describes a characteristic of the goods and 
must be disclaimed.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by revised the disclaimer to read as follows: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “ETHANOL” for International Class 4 and 
"CARDINAL" for International Class 31 apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.Advisory: Partial Abandonment
If applicant does not respond to this Office action within the six-month period for response, 
International Class 31 will be deleted from the application. The application will then proceed with 
International Class 4 only. See 37 C.F.R. §2.65(a)-(a)(1); TMEP §718.02(a).
 
EXAMINER’S AMENDMENT
 
Application has been amended as shown below.  As agreed to by the individual identified in the 
Priority Action section, the examining attorney has amended the application as shown below.  Please 
notify the examining attorney immediately of any objections.  TMEP §707.  In addition, applicant is 
advised that amendments to the goods are permitted only if they clarify or limit them; amendments that 
add to or broaden the scope of the goods are not permitted.  37 C.F.R. §2.71(a).  
 
The following disclaimer statement is added to the record:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “ETHANOL” for International Class 4 apart from 
the mark as shown.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(c), 1213.08(a)(i).

on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120075
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
