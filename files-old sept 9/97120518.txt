Correspondence Email Address:  paula@countrylawshack.comNONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(d) refusal-PARTIAL    
•
Specimens
•
Identification of goods and services and related multiple class application requirements  
•
 
 
Section 2(d) refusal-PARTIAL refusal as to only "apparel including t-shirts and band merchandise"  
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark(s) in 
U.S. Registration No(s). 5091346. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration(s).
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
COMPARISON OF THE MARKSMarks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Applicant's mark is KEEP IT SAXY.
 
Registrant's mark is SAXY.
 
Applicant has incorporated the entirety of registrant's mark into its own mark. Incorporating the entirety 
of one mark within another does not obviate the similarity between the compared marks, as in the 
present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d). See Wella Corp. v. 
Cal. Concept Corp., 558 F.2d 1019, 1022, 194 USPQ 419, 422 (C.C.P.A. 1977) (holding 
CALIFORNIA CONCEPT and surfer design and CONCEPT confusingly similar); Coca-Cola Bottling 
Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106 (C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding 
BENGAL LANCER and design and BENGAL confusingly similar); Double Coin Holdings, Ltd. v. Tru 
Dev., 2019 USPQ2d 377409, at *6-7 (TTAB 2019) (holding ROAD WARRIOR and WARRIOR 
(stylized) confusingly similar); In re Mr. Recipe, LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1084, 1090 (TTAB 2016) (holding 
JAWS DEVOUR YOUR HUNGER and JAWS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii). In the 
present case, the marks are identical in part and the addition of KEEP IT in applicant's mark does not 
avoid confusion.  
 
Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar in commercial impression. 
 
 
COMPARISON OF THE GOODS
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Applicant's relevant goods are "apparel including t-shirts and band merchandise." 
 
Registrant's goods are "Athletic apparel, namely, pants; Denims; Pants."Applicant's goods encompass all types of apparel, including registrant's specific types of apparel.    
Thus the goods must be considered highly similar if not identical.   Note also that registrant's goods 
encompass those for use with bands.
 
As to applicant's t-shirts, neither the application nor the registration(s) contains any limitations 
regarding trade channels for the goods and therefore it is assumed that registrant’s and applicant’s 
goods are sold everywhere that is normal for such items, i.e., clothing and department stores. Thus, it 
can also be assumed that the same classes of purchasers shop for these items and that consumers are 
accustomed to seeing them sold under the same or similar marks. See Kangol Ltd. v. KangaROOS 
U.S.A., Inc., 974 F.2d 161, 23 USPQ2d 1945 (Fed. Cir. 1992); In re Smith & Mehaffey, 31 USPQ2d 
1531 (TTAB 1994); TMEP §1207.01(a)(iii). 
 
Decisions regarding likelihood of confusion in the clothing field have found many different types of 
apparel to be related. Cambridge Rubber Co. v. Cluett, Peabody & Co., 286 F.2d 623, 624, 128 USPQ 
549, 550 (C.C.P.A. 1961) (women’s boots related to men’s and boys’ underwear); Gen. Shoe Corp. v. 
Hollywood-Maxwell Co., 277 F.2d 169, 169-70, 125 USPQ2d 443, 443-4 (C.C.P.A. 1960) (shoes and 
hosiery related to brassieres); In re Embiid, 2021 USPQ2d 577, at *29-30 (TTAB 2021) (shoes related 
to shirts and sweat shirts); Jockey Int’l, Inc. v. Mallory & Church Corp., 25 USPQ2d 1233, 1236 
(TTAB 1992) (underwear related to neckties); In re Melville Corp., 18 USPQ2d 1386, 1388 (TTAB 
1991) (women’s pants, blouses, shorts and jackets related to women’s shoes); In re Pix of Am., Inc., 
225 USPQ 691, 691-92 (TTAB 1985) (women’s shoes related to outer shirts); In re Mercedes Slacks, 
Ltd., 213 USPQ 397, 398-99 (TTAB 1982) (hosiery related to trousers); In re Cook United, Inc., 185 
USPQ 444, 445 (TTAB 1975) (men’s suits, coats, and trousers related to ladies’ pantyhose and 
hosiery); Esquire Sportswear Mfg. Co. v. Genesco Inc., 141 USPQ 400, 404 (TTAB 1964) (brassieres 
and girdles related to slacks for men and young men).
 
The trademark examining attorney has attached evidence from the USPTO’s X-Search database 
consisting of a number of representative third-party marks registered for use in connection with the 
same or similar goods and/or services as those of both applicant and registrant in this case. This 
evidence shows that the goods and/or services listed therein, namely t-shirts and pants, are of a kind 
that may emanate from a single source under a single mark. See In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 1730, 
1737 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Infinity Broad. Corp., 60 USPQ2d 1214, 1217-18 (TTAB 2001); In re 
Albert Trostel & Sons Co., 29 USPQ2d 1783, 1785-86 (TTAB 1993); In re Mucky Duck Mustard Co., 6 
USPQ2d 1467, 1470 n.6 (TTAB 1988)); TMEP §1207.01(d)(iii).  
 
See also the attached Internet evidence, consisting of representative websites showing t-shirts and pants 
sold under the same trademark, establishing that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or 
provides the relevant goods and/or services and markets the goods and/or services under the same 
mark.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are considered related for likelihood of 
confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); 
In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Accordingly, the goods would be provided to the same class of purchasers and encountered under 
circumstances leading one to mistakenly believe the goods originate from the same source. 
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or 
services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer. See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993).Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the 
registrant. TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
Although applicant's mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
 
Specimen for class 41
Specimen does not show use in specific class(es).  Registration is refused because the specimen does 
not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in connection with any of the goods and/or 
services specified in International Class(es) 41.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79 
(TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An application based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for 
each international class of goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege 
use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re 
Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013). 
 
Specifically, the specimen does not clearly show the mark used in connection with live music 
performances.   There is some YouTube video screenshot, but a random YouTube screenshot is not a 
clear and proper specimen for the services.  Note also that producing one's own music is not a service in 
trade performed for others.  For music production, applicant would need to show producing a third-
party's music.    Furthermore, applicant failed to provide the required URL and date of access of any 
website as required.  
 
Examples of specimens.  
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include:  
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the 
goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce atleast as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.”  The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing 
an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before 
publication.  This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, 
including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Specimen-class 25 
Webpage specimen does not include required URL and/or date printed/accessed. Registration is 
refused because the specimen for class 25 is not acceptable as a webpage specimen; it lacks the 
required URL and/or date printed/accessed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a). 
Thus, it is unclear whether the specimen shows the applied-for mark in actual use in commerce. See 
Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP 
§§904, 904.03(g), 904.07(a). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a 
specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of 
goods and services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 
C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a). Because the webpage specimen lacks the associated 
URL and/or access or print date on it, within the TEAS form used to submit the specimen, or in a 
verified statement in a later-filed response, it is unacceptable to show use of the mark in commerce. 
TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
 
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a verified statement, in a signed affidavit or supported by a 
declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746, specifying the URL of the original 
webpage specimen and the date it was accessed or printed.(2)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen), including the 
URL and date accessed/printed directly on the specimen itself or in a separate statement, 
that (a) was in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application 
or prior to the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in 
commerce for the goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to 
allege use. Applicant must also submit the following statement made in a signed affidavit 
or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or new, or originally 
submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the 
filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.”
 
(3)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
 
If applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below.
 
 
Identification of Goods and Services 
Applicant has clearly attempted to circumvent USPTO filing rules by placing obviously misclassified 
goods into the same class as applicant's services, paying for only 1 class.  This is highly improper and 
appears to be an attempt to receive information without paying appropriate fees because applicant's 
prior now-abandoned application for this mark received 2d refusals.   The identification of goods and 
services is indefinite and overly broad must be clarified as detailed in brackets below.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must amend the identification to specify the common 
commercial or generic name of the goods and services. See TMEP §1402.01. If the goods and services 
have no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the product or service, its main 
purpose, and its intended uses. See id.
 
Applicant may adopt the following wording, if accurate:  
 
[clarify that such are live eg. Entertainment services in the nature of live musical performances]; Music 
production services, in class 41; 
 
[specify each item of apparel and properly classify, eg. apparel, namely, t-shirts, pants and t-shirts with 
band insignia, in class 25] 
 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broadenor expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
 
Additional class requirements-Section 1(a)
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) 
already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 2 
classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 class(es). Applicant 
must either (a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or 
(b) restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
not acceptable for any international class. See more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services

Michelle J. MillerUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120518
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
