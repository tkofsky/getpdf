Issue date:  August 23, 2022
Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues
 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusals 
•
Advisory regarding Potential Section 2(d) Refusal - Prior-Filed Application
•
 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusals 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 3077567, 3108684, 5383325, and 5505472. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark "MATRIX HORMONES" in standard characters for 
“Consulting services in the field of hormone replacement therapy; Medical clinic providing weight loss 
solutions, services and programs, nutrition counseling, hormone therapy, including, bioidentical 
hormone replacement, anti aging therapy, and natural hormone therapy, medical aesthetic procedures,including, laser hair removal, laser peels, botulinum toxin treatments, microdermabrasion, liposuction, 
vein treatments, vein therapy, cellulite treatments, body contouring treatments, injectable filler 
treatments, facials, and skin care” in International Class 44.
 
U.S. Registration No. 3077567 is "MATRIX ADVOCARE NETWORK" in standard characters for 
“health care consulting services” in International Class 44. 
 
U.S. Registration No. 3108684 is "MATRIX ENERGETICS" in standard characters for “Medical 
services, namely providing physical, mental and emotional health care, through consultation, therapy 
with nutritional supplementation and medical devices” in International Class 44. 
 
U.S. Registration No.5383325 is "MATRIX MEALS" in standard characters for "Health care services 
for individuals, namely, weight loss program services, weight loss diet planning and supervision, 
weight management programs, and consulting services in the fields of diet, weight loss, diet planning, 
lifestyle wellness, health and nutrition" in International Class 44. 
 
U.S. Registration No.5505472  is "MATRIXVIEW" in standard characters for "Medical services; 
providing laser therapy for treating medical conditions; laser skin and mucosa rejuvenation services; 
laser skin and mucosa tightening services; cosmetic treatment of the face, skin and mucosa; laser 
aesthetic procedures, namely, skin tightening and rejuvenation services; removal of tattoos and 
pigmented lesions..." in International Class 44.
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Here applicant’s mark, "MATRIX HORMONES", is confusingly similar to the registered marks, 
because they all share the term "MATRIX", and it appears first in all the marks. Consumers are 
generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any trademark or service mark. 
See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 
73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between VEUVE ROYALE and two 
VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent feature’ as the first 
word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century 
Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding similarity between 
CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because “consumers must first notice th[e] 
identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 
1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial words is particularly significant 
because consumers typically notice those words first”).
 
In the present case, applicant's mark contains the additional wording "HORMONES" and U.S. 
Registration No. 3077567 and U.S. Registration No.5383325 contains the additional wording 
"NETWORK" and "MEALS" respectively. This wording will not obviate a likelihood of confusionbecause it is disclaimed in the marks, as it is descriptive of the services. Although marks are compared 
in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in creating a commercial 
impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In 
re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or generic for a party’s goods and/or 
services is typically less significant or less dominant when comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 
903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 
F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).
 
U.S. Registration No.5505472, U.S. Registration No. 3108684, and U.S. Registration No. 3077567 also 
contain additional wording, "VIEW", "ENERGETICS", and "ADVOCARE". These additional words 
will not obviate a likelihood of confusion because they do not alter or transform the meaning of the 
marks, and thus, are less significant in terms of commercial impression.  
 
Because the marks look and sound similar and create a similar commercial impression, the marks are 
considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes. 
 
Relatedness of the Services 
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, U.S. Registration No. 3077567 uses broad wording to describe "health care consulting 
services," which presumably encompasses all services of the type described, including applicant’s more 
narrow "consulting services in the field of hormone replacement therapy." U.S. Registration 
No.5505472 uses broad wording to describe "medical services" which presumably encompasses all 
services of the type described, including applicant's more narrow, "Medical clinic providing weight loss 
solutions, services and programs, nutrition counseling, hormone therapy, including, bioidentical 
hormone replacement, anti aging therapy, and natural hormone therapy, medical aesthetic procedures, 
including, laser hair removal, laser peels, botulinum toxin treatments, microdermabrasion, liposuction, 
vein treatments, vein therapy, cellulite treatments, body contouring treatments, injectable filler 
treatments, facials, and skin care." U.S. Registration No.5383325 uses broad wording to describe 
"Health care services for individuals, namely, weight loss program services, weight loss diet planning 
and supervision, weight management programs, and consulting services in the fields of diet, weight 
loss, diet planning, lifestyle wellness, health and nutrition" which presumably encompasses all services 
of the type described, including applicant's more narrow, "Medical clinic providing weight loss 
solutions, services and programs, nutrition counseling...." See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 
USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 
(TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills 
Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. 
Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 
USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
The services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the services] emanate from 
the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 
1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 
2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). 
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots from third-party websites such as, Healthy 
Beginnings Wellness & Esthetics, Weight Loss & Vitality, PrimeHealth MD, Infinite Athlete, and 
Balanced Bodies Anti-Aging Clinic establishes that the same entity commonly provides the services and 
markets the services under the same mark. Specifically, this evidence demonstrates that the same entity 
offers services in the fields of weight loss, hormone therapy, and esthetics, and also provide 
supplements and nutritional counseling as well. Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are 
considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes. See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 
USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 
1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Accordingly, the services are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of confusion analysis. 
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are similar, and the services are related and legally identical in part, there is a 
likelihood of confusion as to the source of applicant’s services, and registration is refused pursuant to 
Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act. 
 
Advisory regarding Potential Section 2(d) Refusal - Prior-Filed Application 
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 79331382 and 79331382 precedes applicant’s 
filing date.  See attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, 
applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood 
of confusion between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  
Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be 
suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.While applicant is not required to respond to the issue of the pending application, applicant must 
respond to the Section 2(d) Refusals above within the six month deadline mentioned above to avoid 
abandonment.
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
