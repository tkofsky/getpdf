NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Partial Section 2(d) Refusal - Likelihood of Confusion with Regard to Class 36
•
Classification and Identification of Services 
•
 
PARTIAL SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL - LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION WITH REGARD TO 
CLASS 36
 
THIS PARTIAL REFUSAL APPLIES TO CLASS 36 ONLY
 
Applicant has applied to register ILP in standard characters for "Payment exchange services of micro- 
and nano-transactions of cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain technology" in Class 36, and "Providing 
online gaming platform for competitive video games" in Class 41. 
 
The stated refusal refers to International Class 36 only and does not bar registration in the other class.
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is partially refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the 
mark ILP in U.S. Registration No. 5031720. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Similarity of the MarksThe applicant has applied for the mark ILP. The cited mark is ILP, owned by 402 Technologies, S.A. 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.” 
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b). The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks. In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 
(TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP 
§1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 
2014).
 
In the present case, applicant’s mark is ILP and registrant’s mark is ILP. These marks are identical in 
appearance, sound, and meaning, “and have the potential to be used . . . in exactly the same manner.” In 
re i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), aff’d, 866 F.3d 1315, 123 USPQ2d 1744 
(Fed. Cir. 2017). Additionally, because they are identical, these marks are likely to engender the same 
connotation and overall commercial impression when considered in connection with applicant’s and 
registrant’s respective goods and/or services. Id.
 
Relatedness of the Services
 
The applicant’s services at issue are “Payment exchange services of micro- and nano-transactions of 
cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain technology” in Class 36.
 
The registrant’s relevant services are “Providing electronic processing of electronic payments via a 
global computer network” in Class 36.  
 
The services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared  services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods and/or services]emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the registration use broad wording to describe "Providing electronic processing of 
electronic payments via a global computer network", which presumably encompasses all services of the 
type described, including applicant’s more narrow "Payment exchange services of micro- and nano-
transactions of cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain technology".  See, e.g., In re Solid State Design 
Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 
1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are highly related See, e.g., In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills 
Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. 
Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 
USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  
See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. 
Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the services, but to 
protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer. See 
In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Therefore, any 
doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the registrant. TMEP 
§1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1265, 62 USPQ2d 
1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 
1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, because the marks are significantly similar and the servicesare highly related, purchasers 
are likely to be confused as to the source of the services.  Thus, registration is partially refused pursuant 
to Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. Applicant should note the following 
advisory.  
 
ADVISORY: PARTIAL REFUSAL RESPONSE OPTIONS 
 
Applicant may respond to the stated refusal by submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal.  
In addition, applicant may respond by doing one of the following:
 
(1)  Deleting the class to which the refusal pertains;
 
(2)  Filing a Request to Divide Application form (form #3) to divide out the goods and/or 
services that have not been refused registration, so that the mark may proceed toward publicationfor opposition in the class to which the refusal does not pertain.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.87.  See 
generally TMEP §§1110 et seq. (regarding the requirements for filing a request to divide).  If 
applicant files a request to divide, then to avoid abandonment, applicant must also file a timely 
response to all outstanding issues in this Office action, including the refusal.  37 C.F.R. §2.87(e).; 
or
 
(3)  Amending the basis for that class, if appropriate.  TMEP §806.03(h).  (The basis cannot be 
changed for applications filed under Trademark Act Section 66(a).  TMEP §1904.01(a).)
 
Applicant must address the following requirement.
 
CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES
 
The identification of services in Classes 36 and 42 is indefinite and/or misclassified and must be 
clarified or reclassified to ensure proper analysis. 
 
In Class 36, the wording “Providing online gaming platform for competitive video games” in the 
identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified to further specify the nature of the services, 
as set forth below. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Additionally, this wording is 
misclassified, as such software is classified in Class 42. 
 
In Class 41, the wording “Payment exchange services of micro- and nano-transactions of 
cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain technology” in the identification of services is indefinite and must 
be clarified to further specify the nature of the services, as set forth below. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.041
 
Applicant may adopt the following suggestions, if accurate: 
 
036: Payment exchange services in the nature of cryptocurrency exchange services, namely, 
processing micro- and nano-transactions of cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain technology 
 
042: Providing temporary use of online non-downloadable software in the nature of an online 
gaming platform for playing competitive video games
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand the 
services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).

your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
