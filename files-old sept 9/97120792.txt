NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Sections 1, 2 and 45 Refusal – Merely Ornamental
•
Requirement: Identification of Goods 
•
Advisory: Multiple Class Application Requirements
•
 
SECTIONS 1, 2, AND 45 REFUSAL – MERELY ORNAMENTAL 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark as used on the specimen of record is merely a 
decorative or ornamental feature of applicant’s clothing and, thus, does not function as a trademark to 
indicate the source of applicant’s clothing and to identify and distinguish applicant’s clothing from 
others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1052, 1127; see In re Lululemon 
Athletica Can. Inc., 105 USPQ2d 1684, 1689 (TTAB 2013); In re Pro-Line Corp., 28 USPQ2d 1141, 
1142 (TTAB 1993); TMEP §§904.07(b), 1202.03 et seq.
 
The size, location, dominance, and significance of the alleged mark as used on the goods are all 
relevant factors in determining the commercial impression of the applied-for mark. See, e.g., In re 
Peace Love World Live, LLC, 127 USPQ2d 1400, 1403 (TTAB 2018) (quoting In re Hulting, 107 
USPQ2d 1175, 1178 (TTAB 2013)); In re Lululemon Athletica Can. Inc., 105 USPQ2d at 1687 
(quoting In re Right-On Co., 87 USPQ2d 1152, 1156 (TTAB 2008)); TMEP §1202.03(a).
 
With respect to clothing, consumers may recognize small designs or discrete wording as trademarks, 
rather than as merely ornamental features, when located, for example, on the pocket or breast area of a 
shirt. See TMEP §1202.03(a). Consumers may not, however, perceive larger designs or slogans as 
trademarks when such matter is prominently displayed across the front of a t-shirt. See In re Pro-Line 
Corp., 28 USPQ2d at 1142; In re Dimitri’s Inc., 9 USPQ2d 1666, 1667-68 (TTAB 1988); TMEP 
§1202.03(a), (b), (f)(i), (f)(ii).
 
In this case, the submitted specimen shows the applied-for mark, 2 JONES RANCH, located directly on 
front of a shirt, where ornamental elements often appear. See TMEP §1202.03(a), (b). Furthermore, the 
mark is displayed in a relatively large size on the clothing such that it dominates the overall appearance 
of the goods. Lastly, the applied-for mark appears to be a design element that is used in a merely 
decorative manner that would be perceived by consumers as having little or no particular source-
identifying significance.
 
Therefore, consumers would view the applied-for mark as a decorative or ornamental feature of the 
goods, rather than as a trademark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and to distinguish them 
from others.
 
In appropriate circumstances, applicant may overcome this refusal by satisfying one of the following 
options:
 
(1)       Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application (or prior to thefiling of an amendment to allege use) and that shows proper trademark use for the identified 
goods in International Class 25. Examples of acceptable specimens that show non-
ornamental use on clothing include hang tags and labels used inside a garment.
 
(2)       Amend to the Supplemental Register, which is a second trademark register for 
marks not yet eligible for registration on the Principal Register, but which may become 
capable over time of functioning as source indicators.
 
(3)       Claim acquired distinctiveness under Trademark Act Section 2(f) by 
submitting evidence that the applied-for mark has become distinctive of applicant’s goods; 
that is, proof that applicant’s extensive use and promotion of the mark allowed consumers 
now directly to associate the mark with applicant as the source of the goods.
 
(4)       Submit evidence that the applied-for mark is an indicator of secondary source; 
that is, proof that the mark is already recognized as a source indicator for other goods or 
services that applicant sells/offers.
 
(5)       Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b). This option will 
later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements.
 
For an overview of the response options above and instructions on how to satisfy each option online 
using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Ornamental Refusal 
webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below. 
 
REQUIREMENT: IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
 
The word "apparel" and “casual clothing” in the identification of goods is indefinite and too broad and 
must be clarified because the word does not make clear the nature of the goods and could identify 
goods in more than one international class. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. The 
following are examples of acceptable identifications: “clothing for protection against accidents, 
irradiation and fire” in International Class 9; “surgical gowns” in International Class 10; “pet clothing” 
in International Class 18; and “shirts,” “shorts,” and “pants” in International Class 25. Therefore, 
applicant must amend the identification to specify the type of clothing.
 
If applicant's “apparel” and "casual clothing" is in International Class 25, applicant may amend the 
identification to insert the word “namely,” after apparel" and “clothing” and then list the specific types 
of clothing items in that class (e.g., shirts, pants, coats, dresses).
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate (additions are shown in bold, deletions are 
in strike-through):
 
International Class 025: Shirts; Hats; Apparel, namely, shirts and pants; Casual clothing, 
namely, shirts and pants 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broadenor expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
 
The application references goods based on use in commerce in potentially more than one international 
class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class:
 
(1)        List the goods by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, International Class 
3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the 
fee already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 2 classes; however, 
applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only 1 class. Applicant must either (a) submit the 
filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) restrict the application to 
the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
not acceptable for any international class. See more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or 
advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerceon or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as 
early as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(a) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
