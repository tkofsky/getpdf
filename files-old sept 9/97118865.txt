rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.

Is it possible to have a phone discussion about the changes? I'd like to have a better side-by-side comparison of 
the changes and specifically what is allowable by law. I would tend to agree with the revisions, but I'd like to 
make sure they're effectively executable for what we need. 
 
Please advise,

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
Introduction:
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.Search: 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02. 
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Disclaimer
•
Mark Description
•
 
Disclaimer: 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “AEROSPACE” because it is merely descriptive of a 
characteristic, function, and feature of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); 
DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 
(Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from Bing shows this wording refers to relating to aerospace, to vehicles used in 
aerospace or the manufacture of such vehicles, or to travel in aerospace. Thus, the wording merely 
describes applicant’s goods and/or services because applicant features aircraft may be used in 
aerospace or relates to craft that travels in aerospace. See attached definition. 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “AEROSPACE” apart from the mark as shown.
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove the 
disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.
 
If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire mark. 
See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1041, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005); TMEP 
§1213.01(b).
 
Mark Description:
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one is incomplete and 
does not describe all the significant aspects of the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. 
Descriptions must be accurate and identify all the literal and design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.37; TMEP §§808 et seq.
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate:The mark consists of the stylized words "ETERNIUM AEROSPACE" and design featuring a 
flower design to the left of the wording ETERNIUM AEROSPACE which is divided by a vertical 
bar. 
 
Color is not claimed as a feature of the mark.
