SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL, IN PART – LIKELIHOOD OF 
CONFUSION

SECTION 
2(e)(2) 
REFUSAL 
– 
PRIMARILY 
GEOGRAPHICALLY DESCRIPTIVE
•
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL, IN PART – LIKELIHOOD OF 
CONFUSION
 
THIS REFUSAL ONLY APPLIES TO THE FOLLOWING 
SERVICES IN INTERNATIONAL CLASS 35: "ON-LINE RETAIL 
STORE SERVICES FEATURING CLOTHING; ON-LINE RETAIL 
STORE SERVICES FEATURING HEADWEAR" 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused in part because of a 
likelihood of confusion with the mark(s) in U.S. Registration No(s). 
4478508.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registration(s).Applicant has applied to register BLUEFIELD STATE COLLEGE 
for “On-line retail store services featuring books; On-line retail store 
services featuring clothing; On-line retail store services featuring 
headwear; On-line retail store services featuring blankets; On-line 
retail store services featuring decals; On-line retail store services 
featuring mugs; On-line retail store services featuring cups; On-line 
retail store services featuring stuffed animals; On-line retail store 
services featuring umbrellas; On-line retail store services featuring 
binders; On-line retail store services featuring pens; On-line retail 
store services featuring tote bags; On-line retail store services 
featuring lanyards; On-line retail store services featuring portfolios; 
Online retail book store services featuring in-store order pickup; 
Administering study abroad programs for college students; 
Promoting education in the science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics (STEM) field; Sports recruiting services for high school 
athletes,” in standard characters in International Class 35.
 
U.S. Registration No(s). 4478508 is BLUEFIELD for, "Clothing, 
namely, headwear, shirts, athletic uniforms, jerseys [jackets]," in 
stylized text in International Class 25. 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark 
that is so similar to a registered mark that it is likely consumers 
would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial 
source of the goods and/or services of the parties.  See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d).  Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-by-case 
basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de 
Nemours& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 
1973) (called the “du Pont factors”).  In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 
F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Any 
evidence of record related to those factors need be considered; 
however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar 
weight in every case.”  In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379,129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie 
Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 
1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally 
two key considerations in any likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) 
the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the relatedness 
of the compared goods and/or services.  See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 
866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. 
Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1380 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 
544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The 
fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the 
cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the 
goods [or services] and differences in the marks.”); TMEP 
§1207.01. 
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
In a likelihood of confusion determination, the marks in their 
entireties are compared for similarities in appearance, sound, 
connotation, and commercial impression.  In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 
866 F.3d 1315, 1323, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1748 (Fed. Cir. 2017); 
Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 
1317, 1321, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting 
Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee 
En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 
2005)); In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 
177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v). 
 
In the present case, applicant’s mark is BLUEFIELD STATE 
COLLEGE and registrant's mark is BLUEFIELD. 
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-sidecomparison of the marks, but instead whether the marks are 
sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a 
connection between the parties.” Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 
F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b). The 
proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks. In re 
Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 2020) 
(citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 
(TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 
1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP §1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 
774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 2014).
 
Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, 
prefix, or syllable in any trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay 
Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 
396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) 
(finding similarity between VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE 
CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a 
‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to 
appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life 
of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) 
(finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF 
AMERICA in part because “consumers must first notice th[e] 
identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the 
identity of the marks’ two initial words is particularly significant 
because consumers typically notice those words first”). In this case, 
both marks share the initial term BLUEFIELD.
 
In addition to being the focus of both marks, BLUEFIELD is also thedominant term. Although marks are compared in their entireties, one 
feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in creating a 
commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 
101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 
753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or 
generic for a party’s goods and/or services is typically less 
significant or less dominant when comparing marks. In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. 
Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 
USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), 
(c)(ii). In this case, applicant must disclaim STATE COLLEGE (see 
below discussion) and so that wording is rendered less significant 
than BLUEFIELD. As such, the term BLUEFIELD is the focus of 
the compared marks. 
 
Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar because applicant’s 
mark, BLUEFIELD STATE COLLEGE, creates an overall similar 
commercial impression with the registered mark BLUEFIELD.
 
Relatedness of the Goods 
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even 
competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See On-line Careline 
Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 
1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 
54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). 
They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the 
circumstances surrounding their marketing are such that they could 
give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods and/or services] 
emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph 
Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. 
Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 
1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).The use of similar marks on or in connection with both products and 
retail-store services has been held likely to cause confusion where 
the evidence showed that the retail-store services featured the same 
type of products. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 
1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding the use of 
similar marks for various clothing items, including athletic uniforms, 
and for retail shops featuring sports team related clothing and 
apparel likely to cause confusion); In re Country Oven, Inc., 2019 
USPQ2d 443903, at *12 (TTAB 2019) (holding the use of identical 
marks for bread buns and retail bakery stores and shops likely to 
cause confusion); In re House Beer, LLC, 114 USPQ2d 1073, 1078 
(TTAB 2015) (holding the use of identical marks for beer and for 
retail store services featuring beer likely to cause confusion); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(ii). In this case, applicant seeks to sell clothing and 
headwear and registrant manufactures clothing and headwear. As 
such, confusion is likely in this case.  
 
In light of the above, a likelihood of confusion exists because the 
marks create a confusingly similar commercial impression and the 
goods and/or services at issue are closely related.
 
Upon encountering applicant’s mark used on applicant’s services 
and registrant’s mark used on registrant’s goods, consumers are 
likely to mistakenly believe that the goods and/or services emanate 
from a common source. Therefore, registration is refused under 
Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant 
may respond to the refusal(s) by submitting evidence and arguments 
in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below.SECTION 
2(e)(2) 
REFUSAL 
– 
PRIMARILY 
GEOGRAPHICALLY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is also refused because the applied-for mark is primarily 
geographically descriptive of the origin of applicant’s services.  
Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); see TMEP 
§§1210, 1210.01(a).
 
A mark is primarily geographically descriptive when the following is 
demonstrated:
 
(1)       The primary significance of the mark to the purchasing public 
is a generally known location;
 
(2)       The goods or services originate in the place identified in the 
mark; and
 
(3)       The purchasing public would be likely to believe that the 
goods or services originate in the geographic place identified in the 
mark; that is, to make a goods-place or services-place association.
 
TMEP §1210.01(a); see In re Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales 
de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1452 (Fed. Cir. 
1987); In re Hollywood Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 1852, 1853 
(TTAB 2014); see also In re Newbridge Cutlery Co., 776 F.3d 854, 
860-61, 113 USPQ2d 1445, 1448-49 (Fed. Cir. 2015). 
 
Applicant, located in BLUEFIELD, West Virginia, has applied to 
register the mark BLUEFIELD STATE COLLEGE in standard 
characters for use in connection with the services in International 
Class 35 that are listed above. 
 
The primary significance of BLUEFIELD is a geographic location, 
namely, a city in West Virginia. BLUEFIELD has around 10,500 
inhabitants. 
See 
attachments 
from 
cityofbluefield.com 
andBritannica.com showing 
the 
geographic 
significance 
of 
BLUEFIELD.
 
Because applicant has its main address in BLUEFIELD, it is 
reasonable that the purchasing public would be likely to believe that 
the services originate in the geographic place identified in the mark, 
i.e., they are performed in BLUEFIELD.
 
Remoteness or obscurity of a geographic location is determined not 
in the abstract, but from the point of view of the average American 
consumer of the particular goods and/or services. TMEP 
§1210.04(c); see, e.g., In re Joint-Stock Co. “Baik,” 80 USPQ2d 
1305, 1309-10 (TTAB 2006) (holding that the relevant American 
consumer, purchasers of vodka, including Russian vodka, would 
likely know the geographic significance of the mark because they are 
most likely either from Russia, have Russian relatives, or became 
familiar with Russia when learning the language); In re MCO Props. 
Inc., 38 USPQ2d 1154, 1155-56 (TTAB 1995) (holding FOUNTAIN 
HILLS primarily geographically descriptive of real estate 
development services rendered in Fountain Hills, Arizona, 
population 10,030, because the record showed Fountain Hills to be 
the name of the town where applicant was located and rendered its 
services, and relevant American consumers in the real estate market 
who came into contact with applicant’s promotional brochure 
specimen would associate the place with the services). Thus, while 
BLUEFIELD is not a large area, it would still be recognized because 
the services of the STATE COLLEGE are rendered in BLUEFIELD.
 
The addition of generic or highly descriptive wording to a 
geographic word or term does not diminish that geographic word or 
term’s primary geographic significance.  TMEP §1210.02(c)(ii); see, 
e.g., In re Hollywood Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 1852, 1853-54 
(TTAB 2014) (holding HOLLYWOOD LAWYERS ONLINE 
primarily geographically descriptive of attorney referrals, onlinebusiness information, and an online business directory); In re 
Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1920 (TTAB 2008) 
(holding NORMANDIE CAMEMBERT primarily geographically 
descriptive of cheese). Here, the term STATE COLLEGE does not 
detract from the mark’s primarily geographic significance. 
Applicant’s services are performed in BLUEFIELD. See attached 
internet evidence from bluefieldstate.edu.
 
Therefore, the mark is primarily geographically descriptive and 
registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(e)(2) of the Trademark 
Act.
 
Applicant is advised of the below.  
 
Supplemental Register Advisory 
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal 
Register. Applicant may respond by submitting evidence and 
arguments against the refusal. In addition, applicant may respond by 
doing one of the following: (1) amending the application to seek 
registration under Trademark Act Section 2(f), or (2) amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 15 
U.S.C. §§1052(f), 1091.
 
To seek registration on the Principal Register based on a claim of 
acquired distinctiveness under Section 2(f), applicant generally may 
(1) submit actual evidence that the mark has acquired distinctiveness 
of the goods and/or services, (2) claim ownership of an active prior 
U.S. registration for the same mark for sufficiently similar goods 
and/or services, or (3) provide the following verified statement of 
five years’ use: “The mark has become distinctive of the goods 
and/or services through the applicant’s substantially exclusive 
and continuous use of the mark in commerce that the U.S. 
Congress may lawfully regulate for at least five yearsimmediately before the date of this statement.” See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(f); 37 C.F.R. §2.41(a); TMEP §§1212.03-.06 et seq.
 
To amend the application to the Supplemental Register, applicant 
must provide a written statement requesting that the application be 
amended to the Supplemental Register. TMEP §816.01; see 15 
U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §2.47.
 
Disclaimer Advisory – Generic Matter 
 
Applicant is advised that, if the application is amended to seek 
registration on the Principal Register under Trademark Act Section 
2(f) or on the Supplemental Register, applicant will be required to 
disclaim “STATE COLLEGE” because such wording appears to be 
generic in the context of applicant’s services.  See 15 U.S.C. 
§1056(a); In re Wella Corp., 565 F.2d 143, 144, 196 USPQ 7, 8 
(C.C.P.A. 1977); In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 
USPQ 766, 768 (TTAB 1986); TMEP §1213.03(b).
 
Applicant may submit a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “STATE 
COLLEGE” apart from the mark as shown.
 
TMEP §1213.08(a)(i).
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide 
one using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS), see

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
