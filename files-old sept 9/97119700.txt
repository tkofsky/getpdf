Search 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Surname Refusal 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is primarily merely a surname. Trademark Act 
Section 2(e)(4), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(4); see TMEP §1211.
 
An applicant’s mark is primarily merely a surname if the surname, when viewed in connection with the 
applicant’s recited goods and/or services, “‘is the primary significance of the mark as a whole to the 
purchasing public.’” Earnhardt v. Kerry Earnhardt, Inc., 864 F.3d 1374, 1377, 123 USPQ2d 1411, 
1413 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting In re Hutchinson Tech. Inc., 852 F.2d 552, 554, 7 USPQ2d 1490, 1492 
(Fed. Cir. 1988)); TMEP §1211.01.
 
The following five inquiries are often used to determine the public’s perception of a term’s primary 
significance:
 
(1)        Whether the surname is rare;
 
(2)        Whether anyone connected with applicant uses the term as a surname;
 
(3)        Whether the term has any recognized meaning other than as a surname;
 
(4)        Whether the term has the structure and pronunciation of a surname; and
 
(5)        Whether the term is sufficiently stylized to remove its primary significance 
from that of a surname.
 
In re Colors in Optics, Ltd., 2020 USPQ2d 53784, at *1-2 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Benthin Mgmt. 
GmbH, 37 USPQ2d 1332, 1333-34 (TTAB 1995) for the Benthin inquiries/factors); TMEP §1211.01; 
see also In re Etablissements Darty et Fils, 759 F.2d 15, 16-18, 225 USPQ 652, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
 
These inquiries or factors are not exclusive, and any of these circumstances – singly or in combination 
– and any other relevant circumstances may be considered when making this determination. In re tapioGmbH, 2020 USPQ2d 11387, at *9 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Eximius Coffee, LLC, 120 USPQ2d 
1276, 1277-78 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1211.01. For example, when the applied-for mark is not 
stylized, it is unnecessary to consider the fifth inquiry. In re Yeley, 85 USPQ2d 1150, 1151 (TTAB 
2007); TMEP §1211.01.
 
See the attached evidence from the applicant's website https://www.jump-nee.com/about, establishing 
the surname significance of Nilforushan. This evidence shows that "Nilforushan" is the surname of the 
owner of the applicant.  (See the attachment from the applicant's website showing that the owner is Ali 
Nilforushan,)  Thus, "Nilforushan" is a surname that is connected with the applicant.  Also attached is a 
Wikipedia webpage showing that "-an" is a common ending for Persian or Iranian surnames, and 
another webpage showing a list of popular Iranian/Persian surnames that end in "-shan" or "-an."  Thus, 
the proposed mark has the look and feel of a surname.  Therefore, the mark is refused under Section 
2(e)(4).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Possible Response  Advisory- File AAU & Amend to Supplemental Register 
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register. Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by 1) filing an 
Amendment to Allege Use (AAU) and then 2) amending the application to seek registration on the 
Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816. 
Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant from submitting evidence and 
arguments against the refusal(s). TMEP §816.04.
 
Note: a mark in an application under Trademark Act Section 1(b) is not eligible for registration on the 
Supplemental Register until an acceptable amendment to allege use under 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been 
filed. 37 C.F.R. §§2.47(d), 2.75(b); TMEP §§815.02, 1102.03. When a Section 1(b) application is 
successfully amended to the Supplemental Register, the application effective filing date will be the date 
applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for the amendment to allege 
use. TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b).
 
Disclaimer Required 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “equestrian tournament” because it is merely descriptive of an 
ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or 
services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from the online Merriam-Webster dictionary shows that "equestrian" means 
relating to horseback riding and that "tournament" refers to a series of games or contests.  The 
applicant's identification of services also includes the term "equestrian" to describe its services.  Thus, 
the wording merely describes applicant’s services because the applicant provides an equestrian 
tournament or a series of games or contests featuring horseback riding.  Therefore, this language is 
merely descriptive and must be disclaimed.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “EQUESTRIAN TOURNAMENT” apart 
from the mark as shown.

Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
