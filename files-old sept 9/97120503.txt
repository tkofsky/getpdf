The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Officeaction.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
 
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Disclaimer Required
•
Information About Applicant's Services Required
•
 
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “LIFE GROUP” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s services.  See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a).   Terms that describe the provider of 
a service may also be merely descriptive of the service. See In re Chamber of Com. of the U.S., 675 
F.3d 1297, 1301, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1220 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (affirming Board’s holding that 
NATIONAL CHAMBER was merely descriptive of online service providing directory information for 
local and state chambers of commerce and business and regulatory data analysis services to promote 
the interest of businessmen and businesswomen); In re Major League Umpires, 60 USPQ2d 1059, 1060 
(TTAB 2001) (holding MAJOR LEAGUE UMPIRE merely descriptive of clothing, face masks, chest 
protectors and shin guards provided, designed, and used by major league umpires); TMEP §1209.03(q).
 
The attached evidence from Macmillan Dictionary shows that "LIFE" means "the period of time from 
someone’s birth until their death"; and "GROUP" means "a set of people who meet or do something 
together because they share the same purpose or ideas."  Thus, the wording merely describes 
applicant’s services because applicant is a set of people who work together to provide consumers 
with insurance related to the period of time from someone's birth until their death.  See also the 
attached evidence from GR Kleinfelter, Scott Insurance, NWLGI, Prosperity Life, and National Life 
showing third-parties using the wording "LIFE" and "GROUP" to describe services similar to that of 
applicant.
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove thedisclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “LIFE GROUP” apart from the mark as 
shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire mark. 
See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1041, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005); TMEP 
§1213.01(b).
 
 
INFORMATION ABOUT APPLICANT'S SERVICES REQUIRED
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must provide a written statement explaining 
whether the services or any aspect of the services is rendered in, or has any other connection with, the 
geographic location named in the mark, namely, YELLOWSTONE. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP 
§§814, 1210.03. Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for 
information. See In re Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP 
LLC, 107 USPQ2d 1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for 
information is an independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 
613, at *6 (TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In 
re DTI P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120503
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
