SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Clarification of Applicant's Entity Type Required 
•
Amended Description of Mark Required
•
Advisory:  Possible Ornamental Refusal
•
 
 
CLARIFICATION OF APPLICANT'S ENTITY TYPE REQUIRED
 
The name of an individual person appears in the section of the application intended for the trademark 
owner’s name; however, the legal entity is set forth as a limited liability company. Applicant must 
clarify this inconsistency. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), (a)(3)(i)-(ii), 2.61(b); TMEP §803.02(a).
 
If applicant is an individual, applicant should simply request that the legal entity be amended to 
“individual” and must indicate his/her country of citizenship for the record. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(i); 
TMEP §803.03(a). Alternatively, if applicant is a limited liability company, applicant must provide the 
correct name of the limited liability company and the U.S. state or foreign country of incorporation or 
organization. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §803.03(h).
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration may be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).  
 
 
AMENDED DESCRIPTION OF MARK REQUIRED
 
First, applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one is incomplete 
and does not describe all the significant aspects of the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 
808.02. Descriptions must be accurate and identify all the literal and design elements in the mark. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.37; TMEP §§808 et seq.  In this case, the description is incomplete because it does not 
reference the cash or the puddle of goo that appears in the drawing. 
 
Second, applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one uses broad, 
vague language that does not accurately describe the mark.  37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 
808.02.  In this case, the description is vague because it is not clear that the chain necklace has a 
circular pendant on which the letters "MM" appears.   
 
Third, aApplicant must delete from the description any text that does not reference things appearing in 
the mark, such as interpretation, assessment, or analysis of the mark elements, or indications of how the 
mark is or is not used or intended to be used. A description must identify only the literal and design 
elements shown in the drawing. See 37 C.F.R. §2.37; TMEP §808.02.  In this case, applicant must 
delete from the description that the mark is intended to be used as an animated character and the 
character's name.The following description is suggested, if accurate:
        
            The mark consists of a humanoid monster with goo dripping down its body that has two 
eyes and is wearing athletic shoes, a beanie, a set of grills in its smiling mouth, and a chain 
necklace around its neck with the letters “MM” on a circular pendant on the chain.  The monster 
is standing in a puddle of goo and has a cigar behind one ear with smoke rising from the cigar. 
 The monster is holding a wad of cash in its right hand.  There is a wad of cash labeled “$10,000” 
coming out of the right side of the monster’s body as if it had a side pocket on its body.  There is a 
wad of cash labeled “$10,000” coming out of the left side of the monster’s body as if it had a side 
pocket on its body.  Four cash bills float in the air around the monster. 
 
 
ADVISORY:  POSSIBLE ORNAMENTAL REFUSAL
 
Applicant is advised that, upon consideration of an allegation of use, registration may be refused on the 
ground that the applied-for mark as used on the specimen of record is merely a decorative or 
ornamental feature of the goods and, thus, does not function as a trademark to indicate the source of 
applicant’s goods and to identify and distinguish them from others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, and 
45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1052, 1127; see In re David Crystal, Inc., 296 F.2d 771, 773, 132 USPQ 1, 2 
(C.C.P.A. 1961); In re Villeroy & Boch S.A.R.L., 5 USPQ2d 1451, 1454-55 (TTAB 1987); TMEP 
§§904.07(b), 1202.03 et seq.
 
The following factors are considered when determining whether the public would perceive the applied-
for mark as a trademark or merely as a decorative or ornamental feature: the commercial impression 
made by the mark on the specimen, any prior registrations of the same mark for other goods, promotion 
of the applied-for mark as a trademark, and the practices of the relevant trade. See In re Todd Co., 290 
F.2d 597, 599-600, 129 USPQ 408, 409-10 (C.C.P.A. 1961); In re Dimitri’s Inc., 9 USPQ2d 1666, 
1668 (TTAB 1988); In re Paramount Pictures Corp., 213 USPQ 1111, 1115 (TTAB 1982); In re 
Jockey Int’l, Inc., 192 USPQ 579, 581-83 (TTAB 1976); TMEP §§1202.03 et seq. For more 
information, see the Ornamental Refusal webpage.

Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
