NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Search ResultsThe trademark examining attorney has searched the Office’s database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).
 
Summary of Issues 
 
Request to Change Applicant Name--No Assignment Filed/Recorded
Definite Identification of Goods and Services Requirement 
 
Request to Change Applicant Name--No Assignment Filed/Recorded 
 
Applicant has requested that the applicant name in the application be amended; however, applicant has 
not provided or recorded in the USPTO database ownership transfer documentation or any other 
documentation showing transfer of title. Therefore, the request to amend the applicant name is denied 
until applicant establishes clear chain of title to the new party. 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §814.
 
If the application was filed by the owner and the original applicant has since changed its name or 
transferred ownership of the mark to another entity, the new owner must file documentation to establish 
its current ownership of the application by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        The new owner must (a) record an assignment, name change, or other 
documentation affecting title with the USPTO’s Assignment Recordation Branch showing 
a clear chain of title to the mark in the new owner; and (b) promptly notify the trademark 
examining attorney that the documentation has been recorded.; OR
 
(2)        The new owner must file either (a) a written statement, verified with an 
affidavit or signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20, explaining in detail the chain of title 
to the new owner; or (b) documentation showing transfer of title to the new owner. 
However, the registration will not issue in the name of the new owner without recording 
chain of title documentation with the USPTO and notifying the trademark examining 
attorney, as specified in (1) above.
 
TMEP §502.01; see 15 U.S.C. §1060; 37 C.F.R. §§2.193(e)(1), 3.73(b)(1); TMEP §502.02(a).
 
Assignments and other documents affecting title may be filed electronically. There is a fee for 
recording ownership changes. 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(b)(6), 3.41(a); TMEP §503.03(d). Recording an 
assignment or other ownership transfer document does not constitute a response to an Office action. 
TMEP §503.01(d). Applicant must still file a separate response to this Office action. See id.
 
If the application was filed by the owner and there is an inadvertent error in the applicant’s name, such 
as a minor typographical error or misspelling, or the name identifies a party that did not exist as of the 
application filing date, the application may be amended to correct the applicant’s name.  TMEP 
§1201.02(c).  In either case, applicant should include in the amendment request the reason for the 
correction (such as “ABC Corporation did not exist as of the filing date of the application,” or 
“Company” was inadvertently omitted from the applicant’s name in the application).  Id.
 
Definite Identification of Goods and Services Requirement
 
The identification of services in Class 38 is accepted.Wording in the identification of goods and services is (1) indefinite and must be clarified, (2) overbroad 
in that it encompasses goods/services in more than one international classification and/or (3) 
misclassified. See TMEP §1402.01. Please see suggested identification below for specific wording that 
requires clarification and/or reclassification. Please note that bolded wording/punctuation indicates a 
suggested addition(s)/amendment(s) to applicant’s current identification to make it definite.   In 
addition, please note that the bracketed entries below require applicant to insert information. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 09:  Downloadable software for connecting computer network users and remote technical support 
specialists, providing remote technical support, maintaining and operating computer systems, 
connecting remotely to computers or computer networks, remote monitoring and analysis of computer 
systems and devices, searching the contents of computers and computer networks by remote control; 
downloadable 
software 
for 
remote 
monitoring 
and 
analysis 
of 
computer 
systems; 
downloadable computer programs for searching the contents of computers, computer networks, 
USB/COM and mobile devices by remote control and accessing data stored thereon and 
transferring data to other devices; downloadable software for connecting remotely to USB/COM and 
mobile devices, remote monitoring and analysis of USB/COM and mobile devices, and searching the 
contents of USB/COM and mobile devices by remote control; providing information and consultation 
in the fields of remote computer access regarding [specify, e.g., access to local area computer 
networks]

remote technical support specialists, providing remote technical support, maintaining and operating 
computer systems, connecting remotely to computers or computer networks, remote monitoring and 
analysis of computer systems, and searching the contents of computers, computer networks, USB/COM 
and mobile devices by remote control and accessing data stored thereon and transferring data to other 
devices; design, development, and testing of computer software; computer software development in the 
field of mobile, desktop, and web applications; providing information and consultation in the fields of 
computer technology, software development, and remote computer access regarding [specify, e.g., 
remote computer backup services, monitoring computer systems by remote access to ensure 
proper functioning]; providing online non-downloadable software for connecting remotely to 
USB/COM and mobile devices, remote monitoring and analysis of USB/COM and mobile devices, and 
searching the contents of USB/COM and mobile devices by remote control
 
Additions to Identification Not Permitted
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06.  Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended.  See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b).  The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification.  TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b).  Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted.  TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please seethe USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
To expedite prosecution of this trademark application, when amending the identification as required 
above, the Office strongly encourages the applicant to select pre-approved wording contained within 
this manual that accurately describes the goods and/or services therein.  Failure to do so may result in 
delay.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
