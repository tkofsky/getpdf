NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(d) Refusal - Likelihood of Confusion
•
Identification of Services Amendments Required
•
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL - LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 2794423 and 4627909 . Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Here, applicant's mark is FUTURIAN for 
 
Class 35: Business organization and management consulting; management consulting services; new 
business venture development and formation consulting services; association services, namely, 
organizing an exclusive membership for leaders and entrepreneurs and promoting the interests of 
members thereof; association services, namely, organizing a business network for entrepreneurs and 
leaders and promoting the interests of members thereof
 
Class 36: Incubation services, namely, providing financing, advisory services, fundraising assistance, 
and introductions to start-ups and existing businesses and their leaders; investment advisory servicesClass 41: Arranging and conducting of classes, seminars, conferences, workshops, trainings, and 
presentations in the fields of leadership, mental health, health, wellness, research and development, and 
medicine and treatments therefor; educational services, namely, conducting classes, seminars, 
conferences, workshops, trainings, coaching services, and presentations in the fields of leadership, 
mental health, health, wellness, and research and development, medicine and treatments therefor and 
distribution of training materials in connection therewith; continuing education services, namely, 
providing live and on-line continuing education classes, seminars, conferences, workshops, trainings, 
and presentations in the field of leadership, mental health, health, wellness, and research and 
development, medicine and treatments therefor 
 
The registered marks are:
 
U.S. Registration No. 2794423 FUTURION for "Business forecasting and sales analysis 
services" in Class 35.
•
U.S. Registration No. 4627909 FUTURIAN for "Computer systems integration services" in Class 
42. 
 
•
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-
by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 
1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 
F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those 
factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in 
every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) 
(quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 
1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 
1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 
USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the 
cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Here, applicant's mark is FUTURIAN.First, the mark in U.S. Registration No. 4627909 is FUTURIAN.  This is identical to applicant's mark.  
FUTURIAN has no particular meaning in English and is a coined term.  See https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/futurian.  Therefore, the marks are identical in sound, appearance, and 
meaning. 
 
Second, the mark in U.S. Registration No. 2794423 is FUTURION.  This is nearly-identical to the 
applicant's mark, differing only in a single letter.  Therefore this is highly similar in sound and 
appearance. 
FUTURION 
also 
has 
no 
meaning 
in 
English. See https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/futurion. 
 
However, 
both 
appear 
to 
be 
plays 
on 
the 
word 
FUTURE.  See https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/future (defining FUTURE as "an expectation of advancement or progressive 
development").  Therefore, this creates a similar impression of advancement or progress.
 
Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar.
 
Comparison of the Services 
 
The services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
Here, applicant's services are:  
 
Class 35: Business organization and management consulting; management consulting services; new 
business venture development and formation consulting services; association services, namely, 
organizing an exclusive membership for leaders and entrepreneurs and promoting the interests of 
members thereof; association services, namely, organizing a business network for entrepreneurs and 
leaders and promoting the interests of members thereof
 
Class 36: Incubation services, namely, providing financing, advisory services, fundraising assistance, 
and introductions to start-ups and existing businesses and their leaders; investment advisory services
 
Class 41: Arranging and conducting of classes, seminars, conferences, workshops, trainings, and 
presentations in the fields of leadership, mental health, health, wellness, research and development, and 
medicine and treatments therefor; educational services, namely, conducting classes, seminars, 
conferences, workshops, trainings, coaching services, and presentations in the fields of leadership, 
mental health, health, wellness, and research and development, medicine and treatments therefor and 
distribution of training materials in connection therewith; continuing education services, namely, 
providing live and on-line continuing education classes, seminars, conferences, workshops, trainings, 
and presentations in the field of leadership, mental health, health, wellness, and research and 
development, medicine and treatments therefor
 
The services in U.S. Registration No. 2794423 are "Business forecasting and sales analysis services" in 
Class 35.
 
The services in U.S. Registration No. 4627909 are "Computer systems integration services" in Class 
42.These services are related.  
 
Specifically, companies that provide business forecasting and sales analysis commonly also provide 
business 
management 
consulting, 
incubation 
services, 
and 
classes 
in 
the 
field 
of 
leadership.  See https://www.rubinbrown.com/Services/business-advisory-services/data-assurance-and-
analysis.aspx; https://www.rubinbrown.com/Services/business-advisory-
services.aspx; https://www.rubinbrownadvisors.com/ (offering business advisory services, and financial 
advisory services under the same mark); https://exigosalesandmarketing.com/smarketing/smarketing-
analysis/; https://exigosalesandmarketing.com/smarketing/smarketing-
consulting/; https://exigosalesandmarketing.com/smarketing/smarketing-training/ (offering 
business 
analysis 
services 
and 
courses 
in 
the 
field 
of 
marketing); https://innovationconnector.com/services/ (offering sales analysis, business consulting, 
financial services, and training services). 
 
Further, companies that provide computer systems integration commonly also provide business 
consulting 
and 
financial 
advisory 
services.  See https://www.affirma.com/consulting-
services/technology-consulting/systems-integration-consulting; https://www.affirma.com/consulting-
services/digital-consulting; https://www.affirma.com/consulting-services/strategy-consulting (offering 
systems integration and business consulting); https://www.reply.com/breed-reply/en/breed-reply-
active-operational-investor (offering 
systems 
integration, 
financial 
support, 
and 
business 
consulting); https://uaoenterprises.com/index.php/services-items/item/23-
analysis; https://uaoenterprises.com/index.php/services-items/item/19-
integration; https://uaoenterprises.com/index.php/services-items/item/18-
business_intelligence (offering business advisory services and systems integration). 
 
The attached  evidence establishes that the services originate from the same sources under the same 
marks.   Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are considered related for likelihood of confusion 
purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re 
Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
The examining attorney further notes that the marks are highly similar or are identical. Generally, the 
greater the degree of similarity between the applied-for mark and the registered mark, the lesser the 
degree of similarity between the services of the parties is required to support a finding of likelihood of 
confusion. In re C.H. Hanson Co., 116 USPQ2d 1351, 1353 (TTAB 2015) (citing In re Opus One Inc., 
60 USPQ2d 1812, 1815 (TTAB 2001)); In re House Beer, LLC, 114 USPQ2d 1073, 1077 (TTAB 
2015) (citing In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1206, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1688 (Fed. Cir. 1993); Time 
Warner Ent. Co. v. Jones, 65 USPQ2d 1650, 1661 (TTAB 2002); In re Opus One Inc., 60 USPQ2d at 
1815); TMEP §1207.01(a).
 
Because the marks are confusingly similar and the services are related, there is a likelihood of 
confusion between the marks.  Consequently, registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(d) of the 
Trademark Act.
 
Response to Section 2(d) Refusal - Likelihood of Confusion 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.REQUIREMENTS
 
If applicant responds to the refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirements set forth below.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES AMENDMENTS REQUIRED
 
Particular wording in the Identification of Services is overly broad and indefinite and must be amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.   The specific issues are set forth below.
 
In this case, the overly-broad wording appears to encompass classes that are already a part of the 
application.  However, if applicant adds wording in other Classes to the application, applicant must 
comply with all Multiple Class Application Requirements, including the payment or relevant fees. 
 
Class 35 
 
The wording "management consulting services" is overly broad and indefinite and must be amended.  
Specifically, type of management is unclear here and could encompass services such as "Business 
management consulting" in Class 35 or "Financial management" in Class 36.  Therefore, applicant must 
clarify the nature of these services and classify them accordingly. 
 
Class 36 
 
The wording "Incubation services, namely, providing financing, advisory services, fundraising 
assistance, and introductions to start-ups and existing businesses and their leaders" is overly broad and 
indefinite and must be amended.
 
First for "providing financing" applicant must clarify the nature of the financing, e.g., "providing 
financing to emerging and start-up companies",e tc.
 
Second, the "advisory" services are unclear and could encompass "business advisory services" in Class 
35 or "financial advisory services" in Class 36.  Applicant must clarify these services and classify them 
accordingly.
 
The wording "fundraising assistance" is unclear and the nature of the assistance must be clarified, e.g., 
"business fundraising for others", "consulting in the field of business fundraising", etc.
 
The wording "introductions to start-ups and existing businesses and their leaders" is overly broad and 
indefinite.  Specifically, this appears to identify "business networking" which is properly in Class 35 
and not in Class 36.  Therefore, applicant must clarify these services and classify them accordingly. 
 
Overall Identification 
 
Applicant may adopt the following Identification, if accurate (wording in bold and italics indicates 
suggestions with notes about the wording in brackets, underlined wording highlights reclassified 
wording): 
 
Class 35:    Business organization and management consulting; [specify type of management in Class

“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
