For assistance with identifying and classifying services in trademark applications, please see the 
USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See TMEP 
§1402.04 
 
Color Claim and Mark Description - Amendment Required: 
 
Applicant submitted a color drawing with a color claim listing the colors in the mark; however, 
applicant did not provide a complete description specifying where each color appears in the literal and 
design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). Therefore, 
applicant must provide a corrected mark description identifying all the colors in the mark and where 
they appear. See TMEP §807.07(a)(ii).
 
Generic color names must be used to describe the colors in the mark, e.g., red, yellow, blue.  TMEP 
§807.07(a)(i)-(ii). If black, white, and/or gray represent background, outlining, shading, and/or 
transparent areas and are not part of the mark, applicant must so specify in the description. See TMEP 
§807.07(d). The following color claim and description is suggested, if accurate:
 
Color Claim: The colors blue, red, tan, gray, and orange are claimed as a feature of the mark.
 
Description: The mark consists of the blue stylized wording "JEJUPASS" with a red dot following 
the final "S" below the image of a tan oval with the image of a blue sky with gray dots depicting 
stars above gray and blue mountains, orange land, and blue waves depicting the ocean. The color 
white represents background, outlining, shading, and/or transparent area and is not part of the 
mark. 
 
Significance of Wording Inquiry: 
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must specify whether “JEJUPASS” in the 
mark has any meaning in a foreign language. If the wording has meaning in a foreign language, 
applicant must provide an English translation. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(9), 2.61(b); TMEP §§809, 814. 
If the wording has no meaning in a foreign language, applicant must provide a statement to that effect. 
See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(9), 2.61(b); TMEP §§809, 814. To respond to this requirement for 
information, open the appropriate Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form 
and enter the serial number, answer “yes” to question 3, and provide the information on the “Additional 
Statement(s)” page in the “Translation” text box(es) in the form.
 
Applicant should provide an English translation. TMEP §809.03. Alternatively, if the wording has no 
meaning in a foreign language, applicant should provide the following statement: The wording“JEJUPASS” has no meaning in a foreign language. Id.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
Intent to Perfect: 
 
The application specifies Trademark Act Section 44(d) as the sole filing basis and indicates that 
applicant intends to rely on Section 44(e) as a basis for registration; however no copy of a foreign 
registration was provided. See 15 U.S.C. §1126(d), (e).
 
An application with a Section 44(e) basis must include a true copy, photocopy, certification, or certified 
copy of a foreign registration from an applicant’s country of origin. 15 U.S.C. §1126(e); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §§1004, 1004.01, 1016. In addition, the applicant’s country of origin must be a 
party to a convention or treaty relating to trademarks to which the United States is also a party, or must 
extend reciprocal registration rights to nationals of the United States by law. 15 U.S.C. §1126(b); 
TMEP §§1002.01, 1004.
 
Therefore, applicant must provide a copy of the foreign registration from applicant’s country of origin 
when it becomes available. TMEP §1003.04(a). A copy of a foreign registration must consist of a 
document issued to an applicant by, or certified by, the intellectual property office in applicant’s 
country of origin. TMEP §1004.01. If applicant’s country of origin does not issue registrations or 
Madrid Protocol certificates of extension of protection, the applicant may submit a copy of the Madrid 
Protocol international registration that shows that protection of the international registration has been 
extended to applicant’s country of origin. TMEP §1016. In addition, applicant must also provide an 
English translation if the foreign registration is not written in English. 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP 
§1004.01(a)-(b). The translation should be signed by the translator. TMEP §1004.01(b).
 
If the foreign registration is not yet available, applicant should inform the trademark examining 
attorney that the foreign application is still pending and request that the U.S. application be suspended 
until a copy of the foreign registration is available. TMEP §§716.02(b), 1003.04(a).
 
If applicant cannot satisfy the requirements of the Section 44(e) basis, applicant may amend the basis to 
Section 1(a) or 1(b), if applicant can satisfy the requirements for the new basis. See 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051(a)-(b), 1126(e); TMEP §806.03. Please note that, if the U.S. application satisfied the 
requirements of Section 44(d) as of the U.S. application filing date, applicant may retain the priority 
filing date under Section 44(d) without perfecting the Section 44(e) basis, provided there is a 
continuing valid basis for registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(3)-(4); TMEP §§806.02(f), 806.03(h).

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
