§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
ADDITIONAL SPECIMEN(S) REQUIREMENT 
  
To permit proper examination of the application, the applicant must submit additional specimen(s) 
because the identification encompasses a wide range of items and/or contains unrelated goods, which 
the current specimen(s) do/does not support.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§ 814, 904.01(a).

open sights for use on firearms or Stun guns or Tear-gas weapons. 
  
If the applicant cannot provide the additional specimen(s), then the respective goods may be deleted 
from the identification.  See TMEP §§814, 904.01(a). 
  
Or, the applicant may amend the basis for the specified goods to a Section 1(b), intent-to-use basis: 
  
To amend an application to one based on a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce under 
Trademark Act Section 1(b), an applicant must provide the following statement, verified with an 
affidavit or signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “Applicant has a bona fide intention to use the 
mark in commerce and had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the application 
filing date.”  See 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2).

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120330
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.

Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
