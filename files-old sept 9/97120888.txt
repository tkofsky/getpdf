NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 22, 2022
Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.Summary of Issues 
 
Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
•
Identification of Services – Amendment Required
•
 
Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Identification of Services – Amendment Required 
 
The services are classified incorrectly in International Class 041. Applicant must amend the application 
to classify the services in International Class 042. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(7), 2.85; TMEP 
§§1401.02(a), 1401.03(b).  
 
Additionally, the first word in the identification of services, "roviding," appears to be misspelled and 
should be corrected. TMEP §1402.01(a).  
 
Finally, the identification for "software; software provider" in International Class 041 is indefinite and 
too broad and must be clarified because the wording does not make clear the (1) nature or (2) format of 
the software and could identify goods and/or services in three international classes – as a product in 
International Class 9 or a service in International Class 41 or 42. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). Specifically, applicant must indicate the purpose or function of the software, 
and if content- or field-specific, the content or field of use of the software. TMEP §1402.03(d). 
Additionally, applicant must indicate whether the software’s format is downloadable, recorded, or 
online non-downloadable. See id. Downloadable and recorded goods are in International Class 9, 
whereas providing their temporary, online non-downloadable use is a service in International Class 42; 
except for non-downloadable game software provided online or for temporary use, which is in 
International Class 41. See TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a)(xii).
 
The USPTO requires such specificity in order for a trademark examining attorney to examine the 
application properly and make appropriate decisions concerning possible conflicts between the 
applicant’s mark and other marks. See In re N.A.D. Inc., 57 USPQ2d 1872, 1874 (TTAB 2000); TMEP 
§1402.03(d).
 
The following are examples of acceptable identifications in International Class 9: “recorded desktop 
publishing software” and “downloadable mobile applications for managing bank accounts.” 
Additionally, the following are acceptable identifications in International Class 41: “providing online 
non-downloadable game software” and “providing temporary use of non-downloadable game 
software.” Finally, the following are acceptable identifications in International Class 42: “providing 
temporary use of on-line non-downloadable software development tools” and “providing temporary use 
of non-downloadable cloud-based software for calculating energy costs.”
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
International Class 042: Providing on-line non-downloadable software used to search, query,analyze, retrieve, monitor, manage, maintain, archive, integrate, process, report on, structure, 
model, present and display content from other computer databases, the internet, and other 
computer systems; providing on-line temporary use of non-downloadable software for creating 
searchable databases of information and data; providing on-line temporary use of non-
downloadable search engine software; computer services, namely, creating for others computer 
network-based indices of information; Providing temporary use of on-line non-downloadable 
software for {specify purpose of software, e.g., creating searchable databases of information 
and data, managing bank accounts, calculating energy costs, etc.}
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand 
the services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e). 
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.

on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120888
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status &

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
