System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office

Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R.§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Identification of Services
•
Disclaimer Required
•
 
IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES 
 
The identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because the nature of the services is 
unclear. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.
 
The wording “conslutig” in the identification of goods and/or services appears to be misspelled and is 
thus indefinite; the spelling must be corrected or the wording further clarified. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01(a). Applicant may substitute the following wording for the incorrect 
spelling, if accurate: “consulting.”
 
Applicant must correct the punctuation in the identification to clarify the individual items in the list of 
goods and/or services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01(a). Proper punctuation in 
identifications is necessary to delineate explicitly each product or service within a list and to avoid 
ambiguity. Commas, semicolons, and apostrophes are the only punctuation that should be used in an 
identification of goods and/or services. TMEP §1402.01(a). An applicant should not use colons, 
periods, exclamation points, and question marks in an identification. Id. In addition, applicants should 
not use symbols in the identification such as asterisks (*), at symbols (@), or carets. Id.
 
In general, commas should be used in an identification (1) to separate a series of related items 
identified within a particular category of goods or services, (2) before and after “namely,” and (3) 
between each item in a list of goods or services following “namely” (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion, bar soap, shampoo). Id. Semicolons generally should be used to separate a series 
of distinct categories of goods or services within an international class (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion; deodorizers for pets; glass cleaners). Id.
 
Thus, applicant should replace commas between the distinct categories of services with semicolons in 
the identification of services.
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate:  
 
Class 39: Cargo Transportation; dispatch services, namely, brokerage and coordination of 
freight and transportation services for goods; consulting services in the field of ____ {specify 
Class 39 field, e.g., cargo transportation, freight brokerage, shipping of goods, etc.} 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
 See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06.  Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not laterbe reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “LOGISTICS LLC” because it is merely descriptive of 
a characteristic of applicant's services and the legal structure of applicant's business.  See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
First, the attached evidence from Lexico shows that the wording LOGISTICS means the commercial 
activity of transporting goods to customers. See attached definition. The attached evidence from Cargo 
Logistics International, Ryder and Worldwide Logistics Group establishes that third-parties commonly 
use this wording in connection with service similar to those provided by applicant. See attached website 
screen captures. Thus, the wording LOGISTICS merely describes applicant's services because a 
characteristic of the services is that they involve the commercial transportation of goods. 
 
Applicant must also disclaim the abbreviation “LLC” because it merely designates the legal character 
or family business structure of an entity and does not indicate the source of applicant’s services. See 15 
U.S.C. §§1051-1053, 1127; In re Piano Factory Grp., Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1522, 1526 (TTAB 2006); In 
re Patent & Trademark Servs., Inc., 49 USPQ2d 1537, 1539-40 (TTAB 1998); TMEP §1213.03(d).
 
Business type designations and abbreviations such as “Corporation,” “Inc.,” “Company,” “LLC,” and 
“Ltd.” or family business designations such as “& Sons” or “Bros.” must be disclaimed, because they 
merely indicate applicant’s business type or structure and generally have no source-indicating capacity. 
TMEP §1213.03(d); see, e.g., Goodyear’s India Rubber Glove Mfg. Co. v. Goodyear Rubber Co., 128 
U.S. 598, 602-03 (1888); In re Piano Factory Grp., Inc., 85 USPQ2d at 1526; In re Patent & 
Trademark Servs., Inc., 49 USPQ2d at 1539-40.
 
The wording LLC appears in the applied-for mark. Therefore, LLC must be disclaimed because it 
merely indicates that applicant's business structure is a limited liability company and does not indicate 
the source of applicant's services.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “LOGISTICS LLC” apart from the mark as 
shown.
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120551
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
