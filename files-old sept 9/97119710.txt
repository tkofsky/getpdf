Office Action (Official Letter) About Applicant’s Trademark Application
 
U.S. Application Serial No. 97119710
Mark:  CEDAR'S MEDITERRANEAN FOODS
Correspondence Address:  
PATRICK J. CONCANNON 
NUTTER, MCCLENNEN & FISH, LLP 
155 SEAPORT BOULEVARD

BOSTON MA 02210 UNITED STATES
Applicant:  Cedars Mediterranean Foods, Inc.
Reference/Docket No. 119030-51
Correspondence Email Address:  docket@nutter.com
 
 
NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Search Results 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
However, applicant must address the following requirements:
 
Disclaimer; and 
•
Specimen.
•
 
Requirement - Disclaimer
 
Applicant must provide a disclaimer of unregistrable parts of an applied-for mark even though the mark 
as a whole appears to be registrable.  See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); TMEP §§1213, 1213(a).  A disclaimer of 
an unregistrable part of a mark will not affect the mark’s appearance.  See Schwarzkopf v. John H. 
Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965). 
 
Wording does not need to be merely descriptive of all the goods or services specified in an application. 
In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 
2012); In re Franklin Cnty. Historical Soc'y, 104 USPQ2d 1085, 1089 (TTAB 2012).  Wording is 
descriptive if it is descriptive of any of the goods or services for which registration is sought.  In re The 
Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d at 1300, 102 USPQ2d at 1219 (quoting In re Stereotaxis 
Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1040, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005)). 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “MEDITERRANEAN FOODS” because it is merely descriptive 
of an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence shows this wording means food that is eaten near the Mediterranean Sea, and the 
foods denoted to be Mediterranean foods in the attached evidence include foods listed by the applicant 
in the applicaiton.  Thus, the wording merely describes applicant’s goods because it indicates the type 
of cuisine that applicant is providing.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “MEDITERRANEAN FOODS” apart from 
the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
Requirement - Specimen  
 
Specimen is not an acceptable webpage display. Registration is refused because the specimen in 
International Class(es) 029 and 030 is not acceptable as a display associated with the goods and doesnot show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 
U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §2.56(a), (b)(1); see TMEP §§904, 904.03(g)-(i), 904.07(a). An 
application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for 
mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a).
 
A webpage or catalog display specimen (1) must show use of the mark directly associated with the 
goods and (2) such use must be of a point-of-sale nature. 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1). This means that this 
type of display specimen must include the following:
 
(1)        A picture or sufficient textual description of the goods;
 
(2)        The mark associated with the goods; and
 
(3)        A means for ordering the goods such as a “shopping cart” button/link, an 
order form, or a telephone number for placing orders.
 
See In re Sones, 590 F.3d 1282, 1286-89, 93 USPQ2d 1118, 1122-24 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re Azteca 
Sys., Inc., 102 USPQ2d 1955, 1957-58 (TTAB 2012); In re Dell Inc., 71 USPQ2d 1725, 1727 (TTAB 
2004); Lands’ End v. Manbeck, 797 F. Supp. 511, 514, 24 USPQ2d 1314, 1316 (E.D. Va. 1992); 
TMEP §904.03(h), (i)-.03(i)(D).
 
In this case, the specimen does not show sufficient means for ordering the goods.  Specifically, there is 
no pricing information shown and there is no ability to add the goods to an online shopping cart or 
otherwise order them. 
 
Accordingly, such material is mere advertising, which is not acceptable as a specimen for goods. See In 
re Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 265039, at *15-16 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re Siny Corp., 
920 F.3d 1331, 1336, 2019 USPQ2d 127099, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. 2019)); see also Avakoff v. S. Pac. Co., 
765 F.2d 1097, 1098, 226 USPQ 435, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §904.04(b), (c).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  As specified above, a webpage specimen submitted as a display associated 
with the goods must show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and 
include information necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), 
(c).  Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL 
and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the 
specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed 
response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commercefor the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
