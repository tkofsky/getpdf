2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.

SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION 
- CLASS 18
 
The stated refusal refers to International Class 18 only and does not bar registration in the other 
classes.
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 6606720 and 4915540. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Here, applicant seeks registration of THE NASH COLLECTION in stylized font in connection with 
"Bags, namely, tote bags, athletic bags, backpacks, book bags, sports bags, bum bags, handbags, sports 
bags, tote bags, travelling bags; Luggage tags; Briefcases; Wallets; Credit card holders; Pet products, 
namely, collars, leashes, bandanas."

Comparison of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).  
 
Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of 
terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See 
Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), 
aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 
1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH 
confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM 
and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
In this case, all the wording in applicant's mark is contained in the marks in the cited registrations.  
Applicant's mark adds the word THE and a word that applicant must disclaim, as will be discussed in 
greater detail below.    When comparing similar marks, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has 
found that inclusion of the term “the” at the beginning of one of the marks will generally not affect or 
otherwise diminish the overall similarity between the marks. See In re Thor Tech Inc., 90 USPQ2d 
1634, 1635 (TTAB 2009).  Further, matter that is descriptive of or generic for a party’s goods and/or 
services is typically less significant or less dominant when comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 
903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 
F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).
 
Accordingly, the dominant feature in each mark is NASH, which is the identical term in each mark.  As 
such, applicant's mark creates a similar overall commercial impression to the mark in the citedregistrations.
 
Relatedness of the Goods  
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots from Coach, Fossil, and Tumi, establishes 
that the various goods in the instant application are made and sold under the same mark to the same 
consumers via the same trade channels as the various goods in the cited registrations.  Thus, applicant’s 
and registrant’s goods and/or services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, 
e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. 
Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
 
Thus, upon encountering applicant’s and registrant’s marks, consumers are likely to be confused and 
mistakenly believe that the respective goods emanate from a common source.  Accordingly, applicant’s 
mark must be refused registration under Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act.
 
Response Options
 
Applicant may respond to the stated refusal by submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal.  
In addition, applicant may respond by doing one of the following:
 
(1)  Deleting the class to which the refusal pertains;
 
(2)  Filing a Request to Divide Application form (form #3) to divide out the goods and/or 
services that have not been refused registration, so that the mark may proceed toward publication 
for opposition in the classes to which the refusal does not pertain.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.87.  See 
generally TMEP §§1110 et seq. (regarding the requirements for filing a request to divide).  If 
applicant files a request to divide, then to avoid abandonment, applicant must also file a timely 
response to all outstanding issues in this Office action, including the refusal.  37 C.F.R. §2.87(e). 
 
 
Applicant should note the following additional ground for refusal.
 
SUBSTITUTE SPECIMEN REQUIERD - CLASS 18 
 
Registration is refused because the specimen does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in 
commerce in connection with any of the goods and/or services specified in International Class(es) 18.  
Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re 
Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79 (TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 
1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods and/or 
services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 
USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013).Specifically, the tag on the pet collar and leash shown in Class 18 contain the mark ALL STAR DOGS 
on the tag and only the word NASH on the goods in an ornamental fashion.  Here, the applied-for mark 
is THE NASH COLLECTION in a stylized font.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include:  
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the 
goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.”  The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing 
an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before 
publication.  This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, 
including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage. 
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “COLLECTION” because it is merely descriptive of an 
ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or 
services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from The American Heritage Dictionary shows this wording means "A line of 
products produced for one season, as those developed by a designer."  Thus, the wording merely 
describes a feature of applicant's goods, in that the goods are from a line of products as well as 
applicant's services which feature the sale of applicant's line of goods.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “COLLECTION” apart from the mark as 
shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES 
 
The wording “Paper products, namely, agendas, calendars, decals, notebooks, stationery, stickers, 
novelty buttons” in the identification of goods for International Class 16 must be clarified because it is 
too broad and could include goods in other international classes. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.03. In particular, all of this wording but for "novelty buttons" is classified in Class 16 
whereas novelty buttons are classified in Class 26.
 
In Clas 18, the wording "sports bags" and "tote bags" are duplicate entries in the same clause.  
Applicant is advised to delete this wording or further narrow it. See generally TMEP §§1402.01, 
1402.01(a). If applicant does not respond to this issue, be advised that the USPTO will remove 
duplicate entries from the identification prior to registration.
 
If modifying one of the duplicate entries, applicant may amend it to clarify or limit the goods and/or 
services, but not to broaden or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Also, generally, any 
deleted goods and/or services may not later be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
In addition, applicant must clarify the types of collars, leashes and bandanas in Class 18.
 
In Class 21, applicant must indicate its foam drink holders are sleeves for proper classification in Class 
21.  Further, the wording "Insulated drinking cups and parts and fittings therefor" is indefinite and must 
be clarified to indicate the specific part(s) or indicate the goods are replacement parts.
 
In Class 25, the wording "denims" is indefinite and must be clarified to indicate the specific nature of 
the goods.  Further, the wording "outerwear" and "baby clothes" is indefinite and must be clarified to 
indicate the specific articles of each.  Finally, the wording "jackets" in the identification of goods for 
International Class 25 must be clarified because it is too broad and could include goods in other 
international classes. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. In particular, this wording 
could encompass straight jackets in Class 10, clothing jackets in Class 25, swimming jackets in Class 
28. 
 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate (changes in bold):Class 14: is definite as filed
 
Class 16: Paper products, namely, agendas, calendars, decals, notebooks, stationery, stickers, novelty 
buttons
 
Class 18: Bags, namely, tote bags, athletic bags, backpacks, book bags, sports bags, bum bags, 
handbags, sports bags, tote bags, travelling bags; Luggage tags; Briefcases; Wallets; Credit card 
holders; Pet products, namely, {indicate type e.g., pet} collars,{indicate type e.g., animal} leashes, 
bandanas in the nature of {indicate type of bandana properly classified in Class 18 e.g., being 
clothing for pets}
 
Class 21: Beverage glassware; Bottle openers; Mugs; Plastic water bottles sold empty; Foam drink 
holders being sleeves; Thermal insulated containers for food or beverages; Insulated drinking cups and 
replacement parts and fittings therefor; Insulating sleeve holder for beverage cups; Drinking cups sold 
with lids therefor; Drinking cups for babies and children; Cups, bottles, and mugs sold with lids that 
double as a cup, sold empty
 
Class 24: is definite as filed
 
Class 25: Clothing, namely, denim jackets, denims in the nature of pants, clothing jackets, leggings, 
outerwear in the nature of {indicate specific good(s) e.g., outer jackets}, coats, hats, beanies, gloves, 
shirts, socks, women's tops, sweaters, sweatshirts, toboggan hats, yoga pants, yoga shirts, athletic shirts, 
baseball caps, trucker hats, flat bill hats, collared shirts, hooded sweatshirts, long-sleeved shirts, polo 
shirts, short-sleeved shirts, sports shirts, tee shirts, baby clothes in the nature of {indicate specific 
good(s) e.g., one-piece garments for babies}
 
Class 26: Novelty buttons 
 
Class 035: is definite as filed 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e). 
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
The application identifies goods and/or services that are classified in at least eight classes; however, 
applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only seven classes. In a multiple-class application, a fee for each 
class is required. 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a)(2), (b)(2); TMEP §§810.01, 1403.01. For more information about 
adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
Therefore, applicant must either (1) restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees 
already paid, or (2) submit the fees for each additional class.
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R.§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already 
paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application identifies 
goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least eight classes; 
however, applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only seven classes. Applicant must either 
(a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) restrict the 
application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce for 
each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for classes 14, 16, 21, 24, 25, 26, and 35; and applicant needs a specimen for 
class 18. See more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or 
advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce on or 
in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as early 
as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).

Attorney of Record
Robert O. FoxUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120403
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
