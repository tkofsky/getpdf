SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL - LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 5428868, 4884276, and 4741777. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
The applicant’s mark is FLEETSMARTS for Software, transportation services.  The registrant’s marks 
are: 
 
4884276
FLEET-SMART for Rental of light duty vehicles, namely, light duty trucks, off road utility vehicles or 
similar equipment for use in construction and related industrial and commercial applications 
 
4741777
SMARTFLEET for Automated vehicle tracking and vehicle fleet management services, namely, 
vehicle fleet tracking services utilizing GPS location tracking capabilities and communications 
technologies to provide real time vehicle location information, including detailed maps, images and 
addresses showing where vehicles are and have been5428868 
FLEET SMARTHUB
Computer software for use in the field of fleet vehicle management; computer software used to track, 
store, monitor, and transmit fleet vehicle data; computer software used to remit payment of invoices 
 
Comparison of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
As to FLEET-SMART and FLEET SMARTHUB 
 
The applicant’s mark FLEETSMARTS, is similar to the registered marks FLEET-SMART and FLEET 
SMARTHUB, because all contain the similar terms FLEET and SMART.  Marks may be confusingly 
similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the 
compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 
USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly 
similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and 
CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
As to SMARTFLEET
 
Confusion is likely between two marks consisting of reverse combinations of the same elements if they 
convey the same meaning or create substantially similar commercial impressions. TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(vii); see, e.g., In re Wine Soc’y of Am. Inc., 12 USPQ2d 1139, 1142 (TTAB 1989) 
(holding THE WINE SOCIETY OF AMERICA and design for wine club membership services 
including the supplying of printed materials likely to be confused with AMERICAN WINE SOCIETY 
1967 and design for newsletters, bulletins, and journals); In re Nationwide Indus. Inc., 6 USPQ2d 1882, 
1884 (TTAB 1988) (holding RUST BUSTER for a rust-penetrating spray lubricant likely to be 
confused with BUST RUST for a penetrating oil).  Here FLEETSMARTS and SMARTFLEET are 
essentially a transposition of terms with substantially similar commercial impressions.
 
Comparison of the Goods and Services 
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The applicant’s goods are closely related to the registrant’s goods as they both are software and 
transportation related services likely to travel through the same channels of trade to the same classes of 
purchasers. Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or 
services stated in the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See 
In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the application use(s) broad wording to describe software and transportation related 
services, which presumably encompasses all goods and/or services of the type described, including 
registrant(s)’s more narrow transportation services and software.  See, e.g., In re Solid State Design 
Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 
1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and services are legally identical.  
See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, 
Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter 
IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay 
Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods and/or services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of 
trade, or classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same 
class of purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 
1005 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or 
services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer. See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the 
registrant. TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, because confusion as to source is likely, registration is refused under Trademark Action 
Section 2(d) based on a likelihood of confusion. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. 
 
PRIOR PENDING APPLICATION MAY BE BAR TO REGISTRATION
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 97435716 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
If applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below.
 
INFORMALITIES 
 
SPECIMEN REFUSAL - MERE DEPICTION OF MARK 
 
Specimen is merely a drawing or depiction of the mark. Registration is refused because the 
specimen is merely a photocopy of the drawing or a depiction of the applied-for mark and does not 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the goods and/or services in International 
Class(es) 039, 009, and 042. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (c); In re Chica, 84 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (TTAB 2007); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods and/or 
services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include: 
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following 
statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: 
“The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were inuse in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
the amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this 
statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF SERVICES REQUIREMENT
 
The identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§1402.01. Applicant must amend the identification to specify the common commercial or generic name 
of the services. See TMEP §1402.01. If the services have no common commercial or generic name, 
applicant must describe or explain the nature of the services using clear and succinct language. See id.
 
The wording in the identification is indefinite for the following reasons:
 
The identification for software is indefinite and too broad and must be clarified because the wording 
does not make clear the (1) nature or (2) format of the software and could identify goods and/or 
services in two international classes – as a product in International Class 9 or a service in International 
Class 42. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). Specifically, applicant must 
indicate the purpose or function of the software, and if content- or field-specific, the content or field of 
use of the software. TMEP §1402.03(d). Additionally, applicant must indicate whether the software’s 
format is downloadable, recorded, or online non-downloadable. See id. Downloadable and recorded 
goods are in International Class 9, whereas providing their temporary, online non-downloadable use is 
a service in International Class 42. See TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a)(xii).
 
The USPTO requires such specificity in order for a trademark examining attorney to examine the 
application properly and make appropriate decisions concerning possible conflicts between the 
applicant’s mark and other marks. See In re N.A.D. Inc., 57 USPQ2d 1872, 1874 (TTAB 2000); TMEP 
§1402.03(d).
 
"Transportation services," is indefinite as it may include services in more than one international class. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate (changes in bold):
 
Class 009: downloadable software for transportation logistics planning
 
Class 035: Transportation logistics services, namely, arranging the transportation of goods for 
others
 
Class 039: transportation consulting services
 
Class 042: online non-downloadable software for transportation logistics planningApplicant must amend the application to classify the goods and/or services in the International 
Classes shown above. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(7), 2.85; TMEP §§1401.02(a), 1401.03(b). 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTIPLE CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENT 
 
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) 
already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 4 
classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 class(es). Applicant 
must either (a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or 
(b) restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
not acceptable for any international class. See more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or 
advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce 
on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as 
early as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).

Matthew D. SteinUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120716
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
