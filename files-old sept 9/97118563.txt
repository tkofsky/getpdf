Mark:  NAZIRA BABY

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
If the applicant agrees with the requirements below and would like to resolve the issue via an 
Examiner’s Amendment, please e-mail the examining attorney at: colleen.dombrow@uspto.gov  
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues:
Requirement - Disclaimer 
•
Requirement - Color Claim and Mark Description
•
 
1.  Advisory - Search Results: 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
2.  Requirement - Disclaimer: 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “BABY” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from the dictionary shows this wording means "A very young child; an infant".  
Consumers encountering the word BABY in connection with the applied-for goods, "cribs for babies" 
will immediately understand that the intended user of the applicant's cribs are babies.  Accordingly, 
because the word BABY immediately describes a feature of or characteristic of the applied-for goods, 
this word must be disclaimed.
 
 PLEASE NOTE:  A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not 
claim exclusive rights to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, 
Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not 
physically remove the disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. 
See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.  
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “BABY” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
3.  Requirement - Color Claim and Mark Description: 
Applicant must amend the color claim and description to identify all the colors in the drawing of the 
mark. See 37 C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). In this case, the applicant claims the colors 
Pantone 7477 and Pantone 331.  However, as this wording does not appear in connection with a color 
identifier it is unclear.  TMEP §808.02.  Please clarify the  colors being claimed as a feature of the 
mark.
 
A complete color claim must reference all the colors appearing in the drawing of the mark. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1); TMEP §§807.07(a) et seq. Similarly, a complete description of a mark depicted in 
color must specify where the colors appear in the literal and design elements of the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.37, 2.52(b)(1); TMEP §§807.07(a) et seq. If black, white, and/or gray represent background, 
outlining, shading, and/or transparent areas and are not part of the mark, applicant must so specify in 
the description. See TMEP §807.07(d).The following color claim and description are suggested, if accurate:
 
Color claim: “The colors blue and white are claimed as a feature of the mark.”
 
Description: “The mark consists of a stylized design of a baby swaddled in a blanket above 
the word “NAZIRA” which appears above the word “BABY”. The stylized design of the 
baby and the blanket are in the colors blue and white. The words “NAZIRA BABY” 
appear in the color blue."
 
4.  Advisory - Assistance:

informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191;

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 26, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118563
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
