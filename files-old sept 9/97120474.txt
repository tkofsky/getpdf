NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion
•
Section 2(e)(1) - Merely Descriptive
•
Prior-Filed Application
•
 
Registration Refused - Section 2(d) Likelihood of Confusion
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 3147701. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration ("Exhibit A").
 
The applied-for mark is "STATE OF THE ART ACADEMY" in standard characters for "Education 
services, namely, providing live and on-line courses in the field of surgical and non-surgical 
cosmetic procedures; Education services, namely, providing non-downloadable webinars in the 
field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; Education services, namely, providing 
panel discussions in the field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; Educationalservices, namely, providing educational speakers in the field of surgical and non-surgical 
cosmetic procedures; Educational services, namely, providing continuing professional education 
courses in the field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; Educational services, 
namely, developing, arranging, and conducting educational conferences and programs and 
providing courses of instruction in the field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; 
Educational services, namely, conducting informal on-line programs in the fields of surgical and 
non-surgical cosmetic procedures, and printable materials distributed therewith; Providing a 
web site that features informal instruction on surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures" in 
International Class 41.
 
The registered mark is "STATE-OF-THE-ART ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY" in standard characters 
for "Educational services, namely training services and conducting conferences, classes, seminars 
and workshops in the field of cardiology, echocardiography, medical imaging and diagnostics" in 
International Class 41. 
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant: similarity of the marks, similarity and nature of 
the services, and similarity of the trade channels of the services.  See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 
1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
Comparison of Marks
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these 
elements may be sufficient to find the marks confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 
USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d 
per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 (Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
In this instance, the applied-for mark "STATE OF THE ART ACADEMY" and the registered mark 
"STATE-OF-THE-ART ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY" begin with the similar phrases "STATE OF THE 
ART" and "STATE-OF-THE-ART". The phrases are identical except for a slight difference in 
appearance between registrant’s mark, which depicts the wording a compound word with hyphens 
separating the words, that is, "STATE-OF-THE-ART"; and applicant’s mark, which depicts the phrase 
as multiple words with space separating the words, that is, "STATE OF THE ART". As such, the marks 
are identical in sound and virtually identical in appearance, and are thus confusingly similar for the 
purposes of determining likelihood of confusion. See, e.g., Seaguard Corp. v. Seaward Int’l, Inc., 223 
USPQ 48, 51 (TTAB 1984) (“[T]he marks ‘SEAGUARD’ and ‘SEA GUARD’ are, in contemplation of 
law, identical [internal citation omitted].”).
 
The inclusion of the term "ACADEMY" in the applied-for mark and "ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY" in 
the registered mark does not obviate the likelihood of confusion. Consumers are generally more 
inclined to focus on the first portion of wording in any service mark. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 
F.3d 1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two 
initial words is particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”). The first 
portion of each mark is the phonetically identical phrases "STATE OF THE ART" and "STATE-OF-
THE-ART".
 
Based on the foregoing, the applied-for mark and registered mark are sufficiently similar to find a 
likelihood of confusion.Comparison of Services
The compared services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the services] 
emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Here, the services at issue are related because the services commonly emanate from the same 
commercial entity. In support thereof, the examining attorney has attached Internet evidence 
from providers of medical education ("Exhibit B"). This evidence establishes that the same entity, such 
as Stanford Health, commonly provides courses, webinars, and educational training on a variety of 
medical topics, including cosmetic plastic surgery and medical imaging, under the same mark, which 
are marketed and provided through the same trade channels to medical professionals.   
 
Thus, the services of the applicant and registrant are considered related for likelihood of confusion 
purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009).
 
Conclusion
Because the applied-for mark and the registered mark are similar and the services are related, 
registration is refused for a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d).
 
Applicant should note the following additional ground for refusal.
 
Registration Refused - Section 2(e)(1) Merely Descriptive
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a characteristic and the nature of 
the applicant’s services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP 
§§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
The applied-for mark is "STATE OF THE ART ACADEMY" in standard characters for "Education 
services, namely, providing live and on-line courses in the field of surgical and non-surgical 
cosmetic procedures; Education services, namely, providing non-downloadable webinars in the 
field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; Education services, namely, providing 
panel discussions in the field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; Educational 
services, namely, providing educational speakers in the field of surgical and non-surgical 
cosmetic procedures; Educational services, namely, providing continuing professional education 
courses in the field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; Educational services, 
namely, developing, arranging, and conducting educational conferences and programs and 
providing courses of instruction in the field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; 
Educational services, namely, conducting informal on-line programs in the fields of surgical and 
non-surgical cosmetic procedures, and printable materials distributed therewith; Providing a 
web site that features informal instruction on surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures" in 
International Class 41.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015).The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an 
applicant’s services, not in the abstract. DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 
F.3d 1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b). “Whether consumers 
could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the test.” In re 
Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).
 
In the present case, the applicant's mark is merely descriptive of its services. The Oxford University 
Press defines "STATE OF THE ART" and "ACADEMY" as incorporating the latest technology, ideas, 
and features and a place of training or study in particular field, respectively ("Exhibit C"). In the 
context of the applicant's services, this describes a characteristic and the nature thereof, namely, the 
applicant is providing a place of training and study on the latest technology and techniques in the field 
of cosmetic surgery. The descriptive nature of the wording is demonstrated by the attached evidence 
from providers of cosmetic surgery services and training related thereto, which use "STATE OF THE 
ART" to identify techniques and technology that are the most intended to recent in that field and 
"ACADEMY" to indicate that the nature of the organon is one that provides study and training 
("Exhibit D").
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not registrable. In re 
Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., 
DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 
(Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such 
as hypodermic, aspiration, and injection needles and syringes).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services is the combined mark registrable. See In re 
Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services. 
Specifically, whether viewed individually or as a composite result, the wording in the applied-for mark 
conveys that the applicant provides training on the latest techniques and technology in the field of 
cosmetic surgery.
 
Therefore, the applied-for mark is merely descriptive of the applicant’s services and registration is 
refused under Section 2(e)(1). 
 
Advisory: Supplemental Register
Although an amendment to the Supplemental Register would be an appropriate response to this 
refusal(s) in an application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) or 44, such a response is not 
appropriate in the present case. The instant application was filed under Section 1(b) and is not eligible 
for registration on the Supplemental Register until an acceptable amendment to allege use meeting the 
requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been timely filed. 37 C.F.R. §2.47(d); TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03.
 
If applicant files an acceptable allegation of use and also amends to the Supplemental Register, the 
application effective filing date will be the date applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 
37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for an amendment to allege use. TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b). 
In addition, the undersigned trademark examining attorney will conduct a new search of the USPTOrecords for conflicting marks based on the later application filing date. TMEP §§206.01, 1102.03.
 
Although registration on the Supplemental Register does not afford all the benefits of registration on 
the Principal Register, it does provide the following advantages to the registrant:
 
(1)       Use of the registration symbol ® with the registered mark in connection 
with the designated goods and/or services, which provides public notice of the 
registration and potentially deters third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(2)       Inclusion of the registered mark in the USPTO’s database of registered and 
pending marks, which will (a) make it easier for third parties to find it in trademark 
search reports, (b) provide public notice of the registration, and thus (c) potentially deter 
third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(3)       Use of the registration by a USPTO trademark examining attorney as a bar 
to registering confusingly similar marks in applications filed by third parties.
 
(4)       Use of the registration as a basis to bring suit for trademark infringement in 
federal court, which, although more costly than state court, means judges with more 
trademark experience, often faster adjudications, and the opportunity to seek an 
injunction, actual damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
(5)       Use of the registration as a filing basis for a trademark application for 
registration in certain foreign countries, in accordance with international treaties.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(d), 1091, 1094; J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair 
Competition §§19:33, 19:37 (rev. 4th ed. Supp. 2017).
 
Applicant is advised that, if an acceptable allegation of use and an amendment to the Supplemental 
Register are filed, applicant must keep the disclaimer for “ACADEMY” because such wording appears 
to be generic in the context of applicant’s services. See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Wella Corp., 565 
F.2d 143, 144, 196 USPQ 7, 8 (C.C.P.A. 1977); In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 USPQ 
766, 768 (TTAB 1986); TMEP §1213.03(b).
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusals by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. 
 
 
Prior-Filed Application
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 90767458 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application ("Exhibit D").  If the mark in the referenced application registers, 
applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood 
of confusion between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  
Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be 
suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues. However, the applicant must address 
the other issues raised in this Office action.
 
 
Response Guidelines

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
