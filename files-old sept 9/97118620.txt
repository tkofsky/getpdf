NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 22, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
NO CONFLICTING MARKS:The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS: 
 
Class 16 - 
 
In Class 16, applicant's identification is: “Comic books; graphic novels; graphic prints and 
representations; novels; series of fiction works, namely, novels and books.”  
 
The following wording is unacceptable:
 
"Comic books" is indefinite and falls in multiple classes.  The format of the comic books must be 
stated. Effective 01-01-2021, identifications for publications that are goods must indicate if the 
publications are "printed," "downloadable," or "recorded on computer media" (or equivalent wording) 
for proper classification. Publications are classified in Class 16, if printed, and in Class 9, if 
downloadable or recorded on computer media.  Providing online non-downloadable publications 
belong in Class 41.  Please see TMEP §1402.03(e). See below for suggestions. 
 
Classification of goods and services is a purely administrative matter within the sole discretion of the 
USPTO. See In re Faucher Indus. Inc., 107 USPQ2d 1355, 1357 (TTAB 2013) (quoting In re Tee-Pak, 
Inc., 164 USPQ 88, 89 (TTAB 1969)).  
 
For the same reasons as discussed above, "graphic novels" is unacceptable.  The format must be 
stated.  See below for suggestions. 
 
For the same reasons as discussed above, "novels" is unacceptable.  The format must be stated.  See 
below for suggestions.  
 
For the same reasons as discussed above, "series of fiction works, namely, novels and books" is 
unacceptable.  The format must be stated.  See below for suggestions.  
 
Taking the above together, applicant may adopt the following:
 
Class 9:  Downloadable comic books; downloadable graphic novels; downloadable novels; series of 
downloadable fiction works, namely, novels and books 
  
Class 16: Printed comic books; printed graphic novels; graphic prints and representations; 
printed novels; series of printed fiction works, namely, novels and books
 
Class 41:  Providing online non-downloadable comic books, graphic novels, and novels; providing 
online non-downloadable series of fiction works, namely, novels and books
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.
 
Class 25 -In Class 25, applicant's identification is: “Athletic apparel, namely, shirts, pants, jackets, footwear, hats 
and caps, athletic uniforms; baseball caps and hats; belts; gloves as clothing; headbands for clothing; 
hoods; infant and toddler one piece clothing; jackets; jerseys; pants; shoes; short-sleeved or long-
sleeved t-shirts; sports caps and hats; stretch pants; sweat pants; t-shirts; ties; tops; track pants; 
wearable garments and clothing, namely, shirts.”  
 
The following wording is unacceptable:
 
"Headbands for clothing" is unacceptable. On 09-26-2019, this 07-30-2009 entry was deleted because it 
was causing confusion. This wording is no longer acceptable.  See below for suggestion.    
 
"Ties" is indefinite and falls in multiple classes.  The type of ties must be stated.  See below for 
suggestions.  
 
"Tops" is not acceptable alone. However, "tops" is acceptable to identify specific clothing in Class 25, 
e.g., "athletic tops" or when included in a list of clothing items prefaced with the lead-in wording of 
"Clothing, namely," e.g., "Clothing, namely, tops.".  See below for suggestion.   
 
Taking the above together, applicant may adopt the following:
 
Class 25: Athletic apparel, namely, shirts, pants, jackets, footwear, hats and caps, athletic uniforms; 
baseball caps and hats; belts; gloves as clothing; clothing, namely, headbands; hoods; infant and 
toddler one piece clothing; jackets; jerseys; pants; shoes; short-sleeved or long-sleeved t-shirts; sports 
caps and hats; stretch pants; sweat pants; t-shirts; ties as clothing; clothing, namely, tops; track pants; 
wearable garments and clothing, namely, shirts
 
Class 26:  Hair ties  
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.
 
Applicant's goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTI-CLASS REQUIREMENTS: 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark ActSection 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fees already paid (view 
the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that are 
classified in at least 6 classes; however, applicant submitted fees sufficient for only 5 classes.  
Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or 
restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
FEES FOR ADDITIONAL CLASSES: 
 
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118620
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
