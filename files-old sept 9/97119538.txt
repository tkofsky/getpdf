Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Section 2(e)(1) – Merely Descriptive Refusal 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a characteristic or purpose of 
applicant’s services, namely, that applicant is involved in finding farm and ranch real estate.  
Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, Inc., 783 
F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 
373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 
1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. 
Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
Here, applicant has applied to register the mark THE RANCHFINDER for use in connection with 
“Farm and Ranch Real Estate Sales” in Class 36.   
 
Here, the combination of "RANCH", meaning "a large farm for raising horses, beef cattle, or sheep", 
and "FINDER", meaning "one that finds", immediately conveys that applicant provides services to find 
large farms for others. See the attached definitions from Merriam Webster Dictionary and applicant's 
own identification. The addition of the word "THE" does not change the descriptive nature of the 
mark. Adding the term “the” to a descriptive or generic term generally does not add any source-
indicating significance or otherwise affect the term’s descriptiveness or genericness. See, e.g., In re 
Consumer Prot. Firm PLLC, 2021 USPQ2d 238, at *18 (TTAB 2021) (holding THE CONSUMER 
PROTECTION FIRM generic for legal services; adding the definite article “the” did not affect the 
term’s genericness); In re Place Inc., 76 USPQ2d 1467, 1468 (TTAB 2005) (holding THE GREATEST 
BAR merely descriptive of restaurant and bar services; “the definite article THE . . . add[s] no source-
indicating significance to the mark as a whole”); Conde Nast Publ’ns Inc. v. Redbook Publ’g Co., 217 
USPQ 356, 357, 360 (TTAB 1983) (holding THE MAGAZINE FOR YOUNG WOMEN a “common 
descriptive or ‘generic’ name of a class or type of magazine” and incapable of indicating source; “[t]he 
fact that the slogan also includes the article ‘The’ is insignificant. This word cannot serve as an 
indication of origin, even if applicant’s magazine were the only magazine for young women.”).Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not registrable. In re 
Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re Tower Tech, Inc., 64 
USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. 
Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding 
SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as hypodermic, 
aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 (TTAB 
2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner that is an 
integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services is the combined mark registrable. See In re 
Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 
549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In 
re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services. 
Specifically, applicant's mark, THE RANCHFINDER, immediately conveys that applicant is in the 
business of providing services in the nature of finding ranches and farms for others.
 
Ultimately, when purchasers encounter applicant’s services using the mark THE RANCHFINDER, 
they will immediately understand the mark as indicating a characteristic or purpose of the services, and 
not an indication that applicant is the source of the services. Therefore, the mark is merely descriptive, 
and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act. 
 
Advisory regarding Amendment to the Supplemental Register After Filing an Amendment to 
Allege Use to Overcome Refusal 
 
Although an amendment to the Supplemental Register would be an appropriate response to this 
refusal in an application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) or 44, such a response is not appropriate 
in the present case. The instant application was filed under Section 1(b) and is not eligible for 
registration on the Supplemental Register until an acceptable amendment to allege use meeting the 
requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been timely filed. 37 C.F.R. §2.47(d); TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03.
 
If applicant files an acceptable allegation of use and also amends to the Supplemental Register, the 
application effective filing date will be the date applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 
37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for an amendment to allege use. TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b). 
In addition, the undersigned trademark examining attorney will conduct a new search of the USPTO 
records for conflicting marks based on the later application filing date. TMEP §§206.01, 1102.03.
 
Although registration on the Supplemental Register does not afford all the benefits of registration on 
the Principal Register, it does provide the following advantages to the registrant:
 
(1)       Use of the registration symbol ® with the registered mark in connection with 
the designated services, which provides public notice of the registration and potentially 
deters third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(2)       Inclusion of the registered mark in the USPTO’s database of registered andpending marks, which will (a) make it easier for third parties to find it in trademark search 
reports, (b) provide public notice of the registration, and thus (c) potentially deter third 
parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(3)       Use of the registration by a USPTO trademark examining attorney as a bar to 
registering confusingly similar marks in applications filed by third parties.
 
(4)       Use of the registration as a basis to bring suit for trademark infringement in 
federal court, which, although more costly than state court, means judges with more 
trademark experience, often faster adjudications, and the opportunity to seek an injunction, 
actual damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
(5)       Use of the registration as a filing basis for a trademark application for 
registration in certain foreign countries, in accordance with international treaties.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(d), 1091, 1094; J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair 
Competition §§19:33, 19:37 (rev. 4th ed. Supp. 2017).
 
Response Options to Refusal 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
Identification of Services – Amendment Required 
 
The wording “Sales” in the identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.11. To be a registrable service, the activity must be primarily for 
the benefit of someone other than the applicant. See In re Reichhold Chems., Inc., 167 USPQ 376, 377 
(TTAB 1970). “Sales” or “selling” normally refers to selling one’s own goods or services and is not a 
registrable service rendered for the benefit of others. See TMEP §§1301.01(a)(ii), 1402.11. Therefore, 
applicant must delete “sales” from the identification and indicate with greater specificity the nature of 
the service in International Class 36.  
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: "Farm and ranch real estate brokerage".
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand the 
services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e). 
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips onresponding.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal and requirement in this Office action. See TMEP §§705.02, 
709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.
 
Advisory regarding Hiring a Trademark Attorney 
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for

•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
