Mark:  PUMPKIN SPICE MARTINI
Correspondence Address:  
PAMELA ROBINSON

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.Summary of Issues 
 
Search Results and Prior Pending Application
Entity and Citizenship Clarification
Disclaimer Requirement
 
Search Results and Prior Pending Application
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO’s database of registered and pending 
marks and has found no similar registered marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act 
Section 2(d).  TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  However, a mark in a prior-filed pending 
application may present a bar to registration of applicant’s mark.
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 90759262 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
Entity and Citizenship Clarification 
 
The name of an individual person appears in the section of the application intended for the trademark 
owner’s name; however, the legal entity is set forth as a limited liability company. Applicant must 
clarify this inconsistency. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), (a)(3)(i)-(ii), 2.61(b); TMEP §803.02(a).
 
If applicant is an individual, applicant should simply request that the legal entity be amended to 
“individual” and must indicate his/her country of citizenship for the record. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(i); 
TMEP §803.03(a).  The applicant may adopt the following, if accurate:  The applicant, Pamela 
Robinson, is a citizen of the United States.
 
Alternatively, if applicant is a limited liability company, applicant must provide the correct name of the 
limited liability company and the U.S. state or foreign country of incorporation or organization. 37 
C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §803.03(h).  The applicant may adopt the following, if accurate:  The 
applicant, Robinson Soft Brittle, LLC, is a limited liability company of Idaho.
 
*Select only one.
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration may be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).Disclaimer Requirement
 
The applicant's voluntary disclaimer of a registrable term MARTINI is not necessary, and must be 
deleted.  Because of the disclaimer requirement of the other descriptive wording in the mark (see 
disclaimer requirement below), an entire mark may not be disclaimed. TMEP §1213.06; see 15 U.S.C. 
§1056(a); In re Dena Corp. v. Belvedere Int’l Inc., 950 F.2d 1555, 1560, 21 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. 
Cir. 1991); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 n.1 (TTAB 2001). If the applied-for mark is 
not registrable as a whole, a disclaimer will not make it registrable. TMEP §1213.06. Accordingly, the 
disclaimer is not accepted and will not be entered into the USPTO’s database. See TMEP §714.05(a).
 
However, applicant must provide a disclaimer of the unregistrable part(s) of the applied-for mark even 
though the mark as a whole appears to be registrable. See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); TMEP §§1213, 
1213.03(a). A disclaimer of an unregistrable part of a mark will not affect the mark’s appearance. See 
Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965).
 
In this case, applicant must disclaim the wording “PUMPKIN SPICE” because it is not inherently 
distinctive.  These unregistrable term(s) at best are merely descriptive of an ingredient of applicant's 
goods. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd. , 695 F.3d 
1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a).
 
The attached evidence from https://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/1502/get-ready-for-pumpkin-
flavored-everything.html defines PUMPKIN SPICE as a spice with "a mixture of cinnamon, ginger, 
nutmeg, allspice, and cloves,"  The plain meaning of the terms PUMPKIN SPICE immediately tells the 
customer that the toffee contains pumpkin spice, and thus merely describes an ingredient.
 
As a result, the terms PUMPKIN SPICE requires disclaiming as being merely descriptive.
 
An applicant may not claim exclusive rights to terms that others may need to use to describe their 
goods and/or services in the marketplace.  See Dena Corp. v. Belvedere Int’l, Inc., 950 F.2d 1555, 
1560, 21 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 1991); In re Aug. Storck KG, 218 USPQ 823, 825 (TTAB 
1983).  A disclaimer of unregistrable matter does not affect the appearance of the mark; that is, a 
disclaimer does not physically remove the disclaimed matter from the mark.  See Schwarzkopf v. John 
H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 978, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. 
 
If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire 
mark.  See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1040-41, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1088-89 (Fed. Cir. 2005); 
TMEP §1213.01(b).
 
Applicant should submit a disclaimer in the following standardized format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “PUMPKIN SPICE” apart from the mark as 
shown.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
