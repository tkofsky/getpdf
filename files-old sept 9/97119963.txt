SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Refusal - Specimen Does Not Show Mark with Class
•
Significance of Wording
•
Section 2(f) Claim 
•
 
 
Does Not Show Mark with Specific Class
 
Specimen does not show use in specific class(es).  Registration is refused because the specimen does 
not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in connection with any of the goods and/or 
services specified in International Class(es) 045.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79 
(TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An application based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for 
each international class of goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege 
use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re 
Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013). 
 
Specifically, the specimen webpage screen shot shows use of the mark in connection with educational 
services regarding teaching and training, however the specimen does not state or reference the 
applicant's services in connection with the applied-for mark.  Therefore, the specimen fails to show 
proper use of the mark in commerce in association with any of the stated services in Class 045.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include:  (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the 
goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce atleast as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.”  The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing 
an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before 
publication.  This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, 
including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage. 
 
Significance of Wording
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must clarify whether wording in the mark 
has any particular significance, as follows:
 
(1) Industry significance. Explain whether the wording “3TM” in the mark has any meaning or 
significance in the trade or industry in which applicant’s goods and/or services are manufactured 
or provided, any meaning or significance as applied to applicant’s goods and/or services, or if 
such wording is a term of art within applicant’s industry.
 
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §814. If the wording has no significance and is not a term of art in the 
relevant trade or industry or as used with applicant’s goods and/or services, and does not have any 
geographical or other significance, applicant must provide a statement to that effect. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.61(b); TMEP §814.
 
To respond to the above requirement for information, open the appropriate Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and enter the serial number, answer “yes” to question 3, and 
on the “Additional Statement(s)” page in either the “Significance of Wording, Letter(s), or Numeral(s)” 
text box(es) and/or the “Miscellaneous Statement” text box(es), enter the information and/or explain 
documentation being submitted with such information and attach it by clicking the button below the 
text box.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
Section 2(f) Claim - Inquiry
 
Applicant claims that the entire applied-for mark has acquired distinctiveness under Trademark Act 
Section 2(f).
 
A claim of acquired distinctiveness may be construed as a concession by applicant that the entire 
applied-for mark is not inherently distinctive. See Cold War Museum, Inc. v. Cold War Air Museum,Inc., 586 F.3d 1352, 1358, 92 USPQ2d 1626, 1629 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citing Yamaha Int’l Corp. v. 
Hoshino Gakki Co., 840 F.2d 1572, 1577, 6 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir. 1988)); TMEP 
§1212.02(b). 
 
If applicant believes that its mark is inherently distinctive and is eligible for registration on the 
Principal Register without proof of acquired distinctiveness, the applicant has the option to withdrawn 
this claim. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(f); TMEP §1212.02(d). 
 
Applicant may withdraw this claim by instructing the trademark examining attorney to delete it from 
the application record. See id. If applicant does not withdraw the claim, it will remain in the application 
record and be published on the registration certificate. See TMEP §1212.10.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119963
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the

to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
