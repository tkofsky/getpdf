SUMMARY OF ISSUES 
Disclaimer Requirement
•
Mark Description Requirement 
•
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIREMENT  
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “KOREA INVESTMENT & SECURITIES US. INC.” because it 
is merely descriptive and primarily geographically descriptive of applicant’s services.
 
The wording “INVESTMENT & SECURITIES” merely describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, 
function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s services. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 
2012). Specifically, this wording names applicant's services and a featured type of INVESTMENT 
service provided. 
 
In this case, applicant has identified "Capital investment; investment of funds; project financing; 
capital investment services" in International Class 36. (Emphasis added). Thus, the term 
INVESTMENT in the mark names applicant's services. And, the term SECURITIES refers to "Paper 
certificates (definitive securities) or electronic records (book-entry securities) evidencing ownership of 
equity 
(stocks) 
or 
debt 
obligations 
(bonds)." See https://financial-
dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Securities. Investment services providers commonly provide services 
encompassing 
securities. See 
e.g., https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/securities-
services, https://www.northerntrust.com/united-states/what-we-do/asset-servicing/securities-services. 
Thus, the wording INVESTMENT and SECURITIES merely names applicant's services and describes 
a feature of the services. 
 
In addition, the wording “KOREA” and "US" is primarily geographically descriptive of the origin of 
applicant’s  services. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); In re Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel 
S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1451-52 (Fed. Cir. 1987); TMEP §§1210.01(a), 1210.06(a), 
1213.03(a).In this case, the primary significance of KOREA and US is as a generally known geographic locations. 
The attached evidence from CIA.gov establishes that KOREA identifies the southern half of the Korean 
peninsula. See https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/korea-south/#introduction. 
Further, 
the attached definition from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary establishes that the letters U.S. denote the 
Unites States. See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/us. Thus, the primary significance of 
these terms in the mark is as geographic locations.  
 
Further, the attached evidence from applicant's website establishes that the services originate in the 
location named in the mark. Specifically, the attached evidence indicates that applicant is "one of the 
leading securities companies in Korea. See http://www.truefriend.com/eng/main.jsp. Thus, the term 
KOREA in the mark identifies where the services originate. Further, the attached evidence from 
applicant's website indicates that the services are provided worldwide, including in the 
U.S. See http://www.truefriend.com/eng/company/network01.shtm. Thus, the term US in the mark is 
descriptive of where the services may be provided. Accordingly, this wording must be disclaimed. 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “KOREA INVESTMENT & SECURITIES 
US. INC.” apart from the mark as shown.
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
 
MARK DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENT  
 
Applicant submitted a color drawing with a color claim listing the colors in the mark; however, 
applicant did not provide a complete description specifying where each color appears in the literal and 
design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). Therefore, 
applicant must provide a corrected mark description identifying all the colors in the mark and where 
they appear. See TMEP §807.07(a)(ii).
 
Generic color names must be used to describe the colors in the mark, e.g., red, yellow, blue.  TMEP 
§807.07(a)(i)-(ii). If black, white, and/or gray represent background, outlining, shading, and/or 
transparent areas and are not part of the mark, applicant must so specify in the description. See TMEP 
§807.07(d).  
 
Further, applicant merely indicates that the letter "F" in the word "FRIEND" is stylized. Applicant does 
not provide a more detailed description of the design element making up the letter or where color 
appears in this element. 
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate: 
 
The mark consists of the wording "TRUE FRIEND" in brown with a {Specify, e.g., Korean 
character} making up the letter "F" in brown with one stroke that is pastel blue, and the 
wording "KOREA INVESTMENT" in black positioned above wording "& SECURITIES US, 
INC." in black.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120213
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
