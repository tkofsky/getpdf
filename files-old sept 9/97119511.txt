The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03. 
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS (Advisory)  
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
 
 
Applicant must respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
 
 
 
DOMICILE STREET ADDRESS  
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record is for a 
third-party registered agent and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal place of residence or 
principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). A domicile address 
must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an individual 
applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal place of business, 
which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct 
and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
Applications must include an applicant’s domicile address because such domicile determines whether 
an applicant is required to have a U.S.-licensed attorney represent it before the USPTO. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.11(a), 2.32(a)(2); TMEP §§601, 803.05. An applicant whose domicile is located outside of the 
United States or its territories must be represented at the USPTO by an attorney who is an active 
member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a U.S. state or territory. 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); 
TMEP §601.01(a).
 
In this case, the application lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile address 
as follows:  8 The Green, Dover, Delaware 19901. According to the attached webpage evidence, thisaddress is for a registered agent and thus does not appear to be applicant’s headquarters where its senior 
executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); 
TMEP §601.01(b)(1). A registered agent is a person or entity appointed to accept service of process and 
official mail on behalf of a business.
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide documentation showing that the listed 
U.S. domicile address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile. TMEP §§601.01(b)-(b)(1), 803.05; see 37 C.F.R. 
§2.11(b).
 
If applicant amends the application to list a domicile street address located outside of the United States 
or its territories, applicant must appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney qualified under 37 C.F.R. §11.14 as its 
representative before the application may proceed to registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); TMEP 
§601.01(a). See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information. However, if applicant 
establishes its domicile street address is located within the United States or its territories, applicant is 
not required to appoint a qualified U.S.-licensed attorney. See TMEP §601.01(b).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to wizard 
question #5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” 
field, uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the 
checkbox provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be 
hidden from public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address 
listed in the “Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support a U.S. domicile address. Applicant should provide the most 
recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for example 
one of the following:   (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar report; or (2) 
a current certificate of good standing for the corporation or other business entity issued by a federal or 
state government agency. TMEP §601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation 
must show the name, listed domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other 
personal and financial information.
 
To submit the documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to wizard question #3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the 
“Miscellaneous Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support 
the U.S. street address.
 
 
To appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney in the application, applicant should submit a completed TEAS 
Change Address or Representation form. The newly-appointed attorney must submit a TEAS Response 
to Examining Attorney Office Action form indicating that an appointment of attorney has been made 
and address all other refusals or requirements in this action, if any. Alternatively, if applicant retains an 
attorney before filing the response, the attorney can respond to this Office action by using the 
appropriate TEAS response form and provide his or her attorney information in the form and sign it as 
applicant’s attorney. See 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b)(1)(ii); TMEP §604.01./Benji Paradewelai/

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119511
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the

to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
