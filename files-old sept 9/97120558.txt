NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Partial Section 2(d) Refusal - Likelihood of Confusion with Regard to Class 36
•
Classification and Identification of Services
•
 
PARTIAL SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL - LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION WITH REGARD TO 
CLASS 36
 
THIS PARTIAL REFUSAL APPLIES TO CLASS 36 ONLY
 
Applicant has applied to register HASTE ARCADE in standard characters for "Payment exchange 
services of micro- and nano-transactions of cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain technology" in Class 
36, and "Providing online gaming platform for competitive video games" in Class 41. 
 
The stated refusal refers to International Class 36 only and does not bar registration in the other class.
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is partially refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the 
mark HASTEE in U.S. Registration No. 5784070. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 
see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921

Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.” 
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b). The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks. In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 
(TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP 
§1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 
2014).
 
Here, the applicant's mark, HASTE, is confusingly similar to the registrant's mark, HASTEE. 
Specifically, the marks share the wording "HASTE". 
 
First, the marks are similar because they share the wording "HASTE". Marks may be confusingly 
similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the 
compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 
USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly 
similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and 
CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
Further, the additional wording in the marks does not sufficiently differentiate the marks, as the marks 
begin with the shared wording "HASTE". Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first 
word, prefix, or syllable in any trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot 
Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) 
(finding similarity between VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because 
“VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on 
the label”); Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 
1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA 
in part because “consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic 
Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the 
marks’ two initial words is particularly significant because consumers typically notice those wordsfirst”).
 
Thus, because the marks share the wording "HASTE", the marks are considered similar for likelihood 
of confusion purposes. 
 
Relatedness of the Services
 
The applicant’s services at issue are “Payment exchange services of micro- and nano-transactions of 
cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain technology” in Class 36.
 
The registrant’s relevant services are “financial services, namely, money lending, installment loans, 
temporary loans, short term loans, payroll factoring services, charge card and credit card payment 
processing services, cryptocurrency payment processing” in Class 36.  
 
The services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared  services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods and/or services] 
emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the registration use broad wording to describe "cryptocurrency payment processing", which 
presumably encompasses all services of the type described, including applicant’s more narrow 
"Payment exchange services of micro- and nano-transactions of cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain 
technology".  See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. 
Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and 
registrant’s services are highly related See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 
(TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 
USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 
2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods and/or services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of 
trade, or classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same 
class of purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 
1005 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  
See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. 
Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the services, but to 
protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer. See 
In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Therefore, any 
doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the registrant. TMEP 
§1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1265, 62 USPQ2d 
1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 
1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, because the marks are significantly similar and the servicesare highly related, purchasers 
are likely to be confused as to the source of the services.  Thus, registration is partially refused pursuant 
to Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. Applicant should note the following 
advisory.  
 
ADVISORY: PARTIAL REFUSAL RESPONSE OPTIONS 
 
Applicant may respond to the stated refusal by submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal.  
In addition, applicant may respond by doing one of the following:
 
(1)  Deleting the class to which the refusal pertains;
 
(2)  Filing a Request to Divide Application form (form #3) to divide out the goods and/or 
services that have not been refused registration, so that the mark may proceed toward publication 
for opposition in the class to which the refusal does not pertain.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.87.  See 
generally TMEP §§1110 et seq. (regarding the requirements for filing a request to divide).  If 
applicant files a request to divide, then to avoid abandonment, applicant must also file a timely 
response to all outstanding issues in this Office action, including the refusal.  37 C.F.R. §2.87(e).; 
or
 
(3)  Amending the basis for that class, if appropriate.  TMEP §806.03(h).  (The basis cannot be 
changed for applications filed under Trademark Act Section 66(a).  TMEP §1904.01(a).)
 
Applicant must address the following requirement.
 
CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES
 
The identification of services in Classes 36 and 42 is indefinite and/or misclassified and must be 
clarified or reclassified to ensure proper analysis. 
 
In Class 36, the wording “Providing online gaming platform for competitive video games” in the 
identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified to further specify the nature of the services, 
as set forth below. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Additionally, this wording is 
misclassified, as such software is classified in Class 42.In Class 41, the wording “Payment exchange services of micro- and nano-transactions of 
cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain technology” in the identification of services is indefinite and must 
be clarified to further specify the nature of the services, as set forth below. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.041
 
Applicant may adopt the following suggestions, if accurate: 
 
036: Payment exchange services in the nature of cryptocurrency exchange services, namely, 
processing micro- and nano-transactions of cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain technology 
 
042: Providing temporary use of online non-downloadable software in the nature of an online 
gaming platform for playing competitive video games
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand the 
services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.

System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
