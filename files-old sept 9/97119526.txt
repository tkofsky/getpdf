NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 28, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Refusal- Mark Differs on Drawing and Specimen- Option to Amend Drawing
•
Disclaimer Requirement
•
Identification of Services Requirement 
•
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
However, applicant must respond to the following refusal and requirements:
 
REFUSAL: MARK DIFFERS ON DRAWING AND SPECIMEN
Mark shown on drawing does not match mark on specimen. Registration is refused because the 
specimen does not show the mark in the drawing in use in commerce in International Class 038, which 
is required in the application or amendment to allege use. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). The mark 
appearing on the specimen and in the drawing must match; that is, the mark in the drawing “must be a 
substantially exact representation of the mark” on the specimen. See 37 C.F.R. §2.51(a)-(b); TMEP 
§807.12(a).
 
In this case, the specimen displays the mark as "WATZ HOTT GUYANA". However, the drawing 
displays the mark as "WATZHOTT GUYANA". The mark on the specimen does not match the mark in 
the drawing because the mark in the drawing displays the term "WATZHOTT" as a unitary term 
without spacing between the two terms ("WATZ and HOTT"), and the mark on the specimen is 
displays this as two separate terms: "WATZ HOTT". Applicant has thus failed to provide the required 
evidence of use of the mark in commerce. See TMEP §807.12(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Submit a new drawing of the mark that shows the mark on the specimen 
and, if appropriate, an amendment of the description and/or color claim that agrees with the 
new drawing. See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b). The following amended description is suggested, 
if accurate: "WATZ HOTT GUYANA" in standard characters.  Applicant may amend the 
mark in the drawing to match the mark on the specimen but may not make any other 
changes or amendments that would materially alter the drawing of the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.72(a)-(b); TMEP §807.14.
 
(2)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) for each 
applicable international class that (a) shows the mark in the drawing in actual use in 
commerce for the goods and/or services in the application or amendment to allege use, and 
(b) was in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or 
prior to the filing of an amendment to allege use.
 
Examples of specimens.   
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, oradvertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
For more information about drawings and instructions on how to satisfy these response options using 
the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Drawing webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Applicant must respond to the requirements set forth below: 
 
DISCLAIMER OF  DESCRIPTIVE WORDING REQUIRED
Applicant must disclaim the wording “GUYANA” because it is merely descriptive of a subject, quality, 
characteristic or feature of applicant's broadcast services and/or geographically descriptive of the origin 
of the services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1),  15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2) ; DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. 
Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP 
§§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from the Merriam-Webster dictionary shows this wording refers to "a country in 
northern South America on the Atlantic coast". Applicant's services are "audio and video broadcasting 
services over the Internet in the field of music" which is broad enough to encompass music from 
Guyana or Guyanese-style music. See attached entry from Wikipedia describing that "The music of 
Guyana encompasses a range of musical styles and genres that draw from various influences 
including: Indian, Latino-Hispanic, European, African, Chinese, and Amerindian music" and entry 
about Music of Guyana.  Thus, the wording merely describes that applicant broadcasts Guyanese-style 
music, and the term is thus merely descriptive of the subject-matter or style of music, or primarily 
geographically descriptive of the origin of applicant’s music broadcast services, i.e., music from 
Guyana.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “GUYANA” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.  
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove the 
disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES
The wording “Audio and video broadcasting services over the Internet in the field of... and product 
promotions and sales” in the identification of services for International Class 038 must be clarifiedbecause it is too broad and could include product promotion services classified in International Class 
035. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. Applicant must clarify that "product 
promotions and sales" are subject-matter fields of the audio and video broadcast services in Class 038 
and not separable product promotion services. As the specimen of use does not indicate that applicant 
provides separable product promotion services, the examining attorney has not suggested wording in 
Class 035. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:
 
International Class 038: "Audio and video broadcasting services over the Internet in the fields of music, 
and product promotions, and sales."
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.

in this process. The assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance 
explaining the content of an Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot 
provide legal advice or statements about an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
