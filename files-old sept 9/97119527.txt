Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Identification of Services – Amendment Required 
 
The Trademark Act requires that a trademark or service mark application must include a “specification 
of … the goods [or services]” in connection with which the mark is being used or will be used. 15 
U.S.C. §1051(a)(2) (emphasis added), (b)(2) (emphasis added); see 15 U.S.C. §1053. Specifically, a 
complete application must include a “list of the particular goods or services on or in connection with 
which the applicant uses or intends to use the mark.” 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6) (emphasis added). This 
requirement for a specification of the particular goods and/or services applies to applications filed 
under all statutory bases. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(a)(2), 1051(b)(2), 1053, 1126(d)-(e), 1141f; 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.01(b)-(c).
 
The USPTO has the discretion to determine the degree of particularity needed to clearly identify goods 
and/or services covered by a mark. In re SICPA Holding, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *4 (TTAB 2021) 
(quoting In re Omega SA, 494 F.3d 1362, 1365, 83 USPQ2d 1541, 1543-44 (Fed. Cir. 2007)). 
Accordingly, the USPTO requires the description of goods and/or services in a U.S. application to be 
specific, definite, clear, accurate, and concise. In re tapio GmbH, 2020 USPQ2d 11387, at *6 (TTAB 
2020) (quoting In re Cordua Rests., Inc., 823 F.3d 594, 605, 118 USPQ2d 1632, 1639 (Fed. Circ. 
2016)); TMEP §1402.01.
 
“The purpose of the identification of goods [and/or services] is to provide the general population, 
including consumers and members of the relevant industry, with an understandable description of the 
goods and services, which is done by using the common commercial name for the goods [and/or 
services].” In re Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013) (citing In re 
Sones, 590 F.3d 1282, 1289, 93 USPQ2d 1118, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). If there is no common, ordinary 
name for the goods and/or services, applicant should describe the goods and/or services using wording 
that would be generally understood by the average person. See Schenley Indus., Inc. v. Battistoni, 112 
USPQ 485, 486 (Comm’r Pats. 1957); Cal. Spray-Chem. Corp. v. Osmose Wood Pres. Co. of Am., 102 
USPQ 321, 322 (Comm’r Pats. 1954); TMEP §1402.01.
 
An in depth knowledge of the relevant field should not be necessary for understanding a description of 
the goods and/or services. TMEP §1402.01. “[T]echnical, high-sounding verbiage” should be avoided.Cal. Spray-Chem. Corp. v. Osmose Wood Pres. Co. of Am., 102 USPQ at 322.
 
Applicant must correct the punctuation in the identification to clarify the individual items in the list of 
goods and/or services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01(a). Proper punctuation in 
identifications is necessary to delineate explicitly each product or service within a list and to avoid 
ambiguity. Commas, semicolons, and apostrophes are the only punctuation that should be used in an 
identification of goods and/or services. TMEP §1402.01(a). An applicant should not use colons, 
periods, exclamation points, and question marks in an identification. Id. In addition, applicants should 
not use symbols in the identification such as asterisks (*), at symbols (@), or carets. Id.
 
In general, commas should be used in an identification (1) to separate a series of related items 
identified within a particular category of goods or services, (2) before and after “namely,” and (3) 
between each item in a list of goods or services following “namely” (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion, bar soap, shampoo). Id. Semicolons generally should be used to separate a series 
of distinct categories of goods or services within an international class (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion; deodorizers for pets; glass cleaners). Id.
 
Thus Applicant should use semicolons to separate out distinct categories of goods. Here, Applicant has 
grouped numerous indefinite and overbroad services together with commas and used periods at several 
points. This is not correct formatting for an Identification of Services.
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “Consulting, training and facilitation, education and development 
services.” in the identification of goods and/or services in International Class 035 because it is 
indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is 
indefinite because it does not make clear what the services are. Consulting services are distinct from 
educational services. Further, this wording does identify services in more than one international class. 
Consulting services are classified based on the underlying subject matter. Applicant has not provided a 
subject matter, which makes it difficult to suggest where the consulting services should be classified. 
As applicant's mark contains the wording BUSINESS and PERSONAL SUCCESS those will be used 
to provide suggestions. However, Applicant may need to further specify the subject matter of these 
services being offered.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: "Business consultation" in Class 035
 
Similarly, It is not clear what type of training and facilitation is being provided. Nor is is clear how 
facilitation relates to the training being provided. Looking at the usage of commas it appears that the 
facilitation is related to the training being provided in some way.  
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: “Business training and facilitation.” in 
Class 041
 
Similarly, it is not clear what education and development services are being provided. Education 
services generally need to specify the form of instruction (classes, seminars, workshops, etc.) as well as 
the subject matter of those classes. These are generally classified in Class 041.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: "Education and development services, 
namely classes, seminars, and workshops in the field of business and personal success." in Class 041.
 
Applicant has classified “Leadership, middle management and frontline skills training anddevelopment” in International Class 035; however, the proper classification is International Class 041. 
Therefore, applicant may respond by (1) adding International Class 041 to the application and 
reclassifying these goods and/or services in the proper international class, (2) deleting “Leadership, 
middle management and frontline skills training and development” from the application, or (3) deleting 
the remainder of the items in the identification and reclassifying the specified goods and/or services in 
the proper international class. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.86(a), 6.1; TMEP §§1403.02 et seq. If applicant adds 
one or more international classes to the application, applicant must comply with the multiple-class 
requirements specified in this Office action.
 
The wording “Leadership, middle management and frontline skills training and development” in the 
identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because this contains more than one distinct 
service. Additionally, specificity about the field of these training services is needed  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.  
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: "Leadership development training in the 
field of business; business training, namely middle management and front line worker skills training 
and development."
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “Speaking, motivating and inspiring events” in the identification of 
goods and/or services in International Class 035 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make clear what 
the services are. Further, this wording could identify goods and/or services in more than one 
international class. Notably none of these services belong in Class 035. It is difficult to tell from the 
limited information available, but Applicant seems to be describing three different types of services. 
The first would be a speaking service. The second would be some type of motivation service. The final 
service involves some type of event hosting. It is not clear what type of event an "inspiring events" 
would envision. A suggestion based on the vague wording will be provided, but Applicant is 
encouraged to review these suggestions closely and consider adding additional detail as appropriate. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:  
 
“Educational and entertainment services, namely, providing motivational speaking services in the field 
of business; Educational and entertainment services, namely, providing motivational and educational 
speakers in the field of self- and personal improvement; Organizing events in the field of business and 
personal improvement for cultural or educational purposes.” in Class 041
 
and/or
 
"Personal growth and motivation consulting services." in Class 045
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
International Class 035: "Business consultation."
•
 
International Class 041: "Business training and facilitation; Education and development services, 
namely classes, seminars, and workshops in the field of business and personal 
success; Leadership development training in the field of business; business training, namely 
middle management and front line worker skills training and development; Educational and 
entertainment services, namely, providing motivational speaking services in the field of 
•business; Educational and entertainment services, namely, providing motivational and 
educational speakers in the field of self- and personal improvement; Organizing events in the 
field of business and personal improvement for cultural or educational purposes." 
 
International Class 045: "Personal growth and motivation consulting services."  
•
 
If applicant adopts the suggested amendment of the identification of goods and/or services, then 
applicant must amend the classification to International Classes 035, 041, and 045. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.32(a)(7), 2.85; TMEP §§805, 1401.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).  
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Multiple Class Application Requirements for a Section 1(b) Application 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already 
paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). The application identifies goods and/or 
services that are classified in at least 3 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) 
sufficient for only 1 class. Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not 
covered by the submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered 
by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
Disclaimer of Descriptive Wording Required 
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove the 
disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire mark. 
See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1041, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005); TMEP 
§1213.01(b).
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “BUSINESS AND PERSONAL SUCCESS CONCEPT” because 
it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of 
applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro 
Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 
1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from The American Heritage Dictionary shows the word BUSINESS means 
"[t]he activity of buying and selling commodities, products, or services." Applicant's services likely 
involve BUSINESS related topics. The attached evidence from The American Heritage Dictionary 
shows the word PERSONAL means "[o]f or relating to a particular person". Applicant's services likely 
focus on individuals, and motivating them to succeed in the workplace. Additionally, the attached 
evidence from The American Heritage Dictionary shows the word SUCCESS means "The achievement 
of something desired, planned, or attempted." Here, the root of Applicant's services is helping others to 
succeed, whether in business or personally. Lastly, the attached evidence from The American Heritage 
Dictionary shows the word CONCEPT means "A general idea or understanding of 
something." Combined, BUSINESS AND PERSONAL SUCCESS CONCEPT describes services that 
impart ideas of how to succeed in both business and personal matters. Thus, the wording merely 
describes applicant’s services, which include consultations, training services, speaking, and motivating. 
Many of these could involve sharing concepts of how to be successful in business or how to succeed in 
reaching personal goals. 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “BUSINESS AND PERSONAL SUCCESS 
CONCEPT” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
