Correspondence Address:  
GARY A. GREENE 
KAPLAN BREYER SCHWARZ, LLP 
90 MATAWAN ROAD, SUITE 201MATAWAN NJ 07747 UNITED STATES
Applicant:  Diversified Products, Inc.
Reference/Docket No. 6011-004tmus
Correspondence Email Address:  trademarks@kbsiplaw.com
 
 
NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issues below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02. 
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal – Merely Descriptive & Advisory of Potential Generic Refusal
•
Disclaimer Required  
•
Information About Mark Required 
•
 
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL – MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature, quality, characteristic, 
purpose, function and use of applicant’s goods.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); 
see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods.  TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 
874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 
1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 
USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 
U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s goods, 
not in the abstract.  DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1254, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 
1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re Polo Int’l Inc. , 51 
USPQ2d 1061, 1062-63 (TTAB 1999) (finding DOC in DOC-CONTROL would refer to the 
“documents” managed by applicant’s software rather than the term “doctor” shown in a dictionary 
definition); In re Digital Research Inc. , 4 USPQ2d 1242, 1243-44 (TTAB 1987) (finding 
CONCURRENT PC- DOS and CONCURRENT DOS merely descriptive of “computer programs 
recorded on disk” where the relevant trade used the denomination “concurrent” as a descriptor of a 
particular type of operating system). “Whether consumers could guess what the product is from 
consideration of the mark alone is not the test.” In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 
1985).
 
In the present case, the applied-for mark is SPLIT READERS in standard characters for use with 
“Reading glasses”.
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not registrable. In re 
Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re Tower Tech, Inc., 64 
USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB (2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., In re Tower Tech, Inc., 64 
USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002) (holding SMARTTOWER merely descriptive of “commercial 
and industrial cooling towers and accessories therefor, sold as a unit”); In re Sun Microsystems, Inc., 59 
USPQ2d 1084, 1087 (TTAB 2001) (holding AGENTBEANS merely descriptive of “computer software 
for use in the development and deployment of application programs on a global computer network”).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods is the combined mark registrable.  See In re 
Colonial Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Positec Grp. Ltd., 
108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
goods and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods.
 
The first wording in the applied-for mark is “SPLIT”.  With respect to eye glasses, the word "split" 
means having "split lens" or the lens of the glasses being split to provide various 
prescriptions.  See https://www.worldoptic.com/lenses/bifocal-
glasses.php; https://www.bweyecenter.com/baltimore-eyeglasses-frames-
lenses.html; https://spectshut.com/blog/a-guide-to-bifocal-
lenses; https://www.savadaadamichopticians.com/lenses/; https://www.fashioneyewear.com/en-
us/blogs/news/what-are-bifocal-glasses-and-are-they-worth-
getting; https://www.eyegallerysouth.com/products/lenses-coatings/74-bifocal-
lenses; https://www.spex4less.com/blog/what-are-bifocals/; https://www.debspecs.com/split-bifocal-
reader-spring-hinge.html; https://www.vseyewear.com/product-category/glassworking/quartz-
working/split-lens-glasses-quartz-working/.  For example, "Bifocals contain two prescriptions within 
the same lens. The eyeglass lens is split into two sections; the upper part is for distance vision and the 
lower 
part 
for 
near 
vision."  https://www.medicaleyecenter.com/2018/11/11/types-prescription-
eyeglasses/.  As applicant's goods are reading glasses, the wording “SPLIT” in the applied-for mark 
merely describes that the glasses are split and have split lenses.  Thus, the wording “SPLIT” in the 
mark merely describes a feature, quality, characteristic, purpose, function and use of applicant’s goods.The second wording in the applied-for mark is “READERS”.  As stated in the Merriam-Webster 
Dictionary, "readers [are] eyeglasses used for reading or close work [such as]: READING 
GLASSES".   https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/readers.  As such, the word "readers" is 
another 
term 
for 
"reading 
glasses". 
See https://www.warbyparker.com/reading-
glasses; https://www.qvc.com/fashion/accessories/readers/reading-glasses/_/N-
17nsvZ5q34ln/c.html; https://www.dillards.com/c/accessories-sunglasses-eyewear-
readers; https://www.readingglasses.com/collections/best-selling-mens-reading-
glasses; https://www.hsn.com/shop/reading-
glasses/fa0407; https://www.zennioptical.com/readers.  Accordingly, the wording “READERS” in the 
mark immediately names the goods in the application and at least merely describes a feature, quality, 
characteristic, purpose, function and use of applicant’s goods.
 
Thus, taken together, consumers would interpret the applied-for mark SPLIT READERS to mean that 
applicant provides split reading glasses.  Therefore, the applied-for mark is merely descriptive of a 
feature, characteristic, purpose, function and use of applicant’s goods and registration is refused.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant should note the following advisory and must also respond to the requirements set 
forth below.
 
ADVISORY OF POTENTIAL GENERIC REFUSAL  
 
In addition to being merely descriptive, the applied-for mark appears to be generic in connection with 
the identified goods. “A generic mark, being the ‘ultimate in descriptiveness,’ cannot acquire 
distinctiveness” and thus is not entitled to registration on either the Principal or Supplemental Register 
under any circumstances. In re La. Fish Fry Prods., Ltd., 797 F.3d 1332, 1336, 116 USPQ2d 1262, 
1264 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int’l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc., 782 F.2d 987, 
989, 228 USPQ 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); see TMEP §§1209.01(c) et seq., 1209.02(a). Therefore, the 
trademark examining attorney cannot recommend that applicant amend the application to proceed 
under Trademark Act Section 2(f) or on the Supplemental Register as possible response options to this 
refusal. See TMEP §1209.01(c).
 
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “READERS” because it is at least merely descriptive of a quality, 
characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and appears to be generic for 
applicant’s goods.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1)15 U.S.C. §1091(c); In re Water Gremlin Co., 635 F.2d 
841, 845 n.6, 208 USPQ 89, 91 n.6 (C.C.P.A. 1980); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. 
Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 
1213.03(a), 1213.03(b).
 
Here, the applied-for mark is SPLIT READERS in standard characters for use with “Reading glasses”.  
The genus of goods is often defined by an applicant’s identification of goods. See In re Meridian Rack 
& Pinion, 114 USPQ2d at 1463 (citing Magic Wand Inc. v. RDB Inc., 940 F.2d 638, 640, 19 USPQ2d 
1551, 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). In this case, the application identifies the goods as “Reading glasses”, 
which adequately defines the genus at issue.The attached evidence demonstrates that "readers" is another term for "reading glasses".  See, 
e.g., https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/readers stating, "readers plural : eyeglasses used for 
reading 
or 
close 
work 
: 
READING 
GLASSES"; 
https://www.warbyparker.com/reading-
glasses; https://www.qvc.com/fashion/accessories/readers/reading-glasses/_/N-
17nsvZ5q34ln/c.html; https://www.dillards.com/c/accessories-sunglasses-eyewear-
readers; https://www.readingglasses.com/collections/best-selling-mens-reading-
glasses; https://www.hsn.com/shop/reading-glasses/fa0407; https://www.zennioptical.com/readers.  
Accordingly, "readers" is a generic term for "reading glasses".  
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “READERS” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
 
INFORMATION ABOUT MARK REQUIRED 
 
Due to the descriptive nature of the applied-for mark, applicant must provide the following information 
and documentation regarding the goods and wording appearing in the mark:
 
(1)        Fact sheets, instruction manuals, brochures, advertisements and pertinent 
screenshots of applicant’s website as it relates to the goods in the application, including 
any materials using the terms in the applied-for mark. Merely stating that information 
about the goods is available on applicant’s website is insufficient to make the information 
of record.;
 
(2)        If these materials are unavailable, applicant should submit similar 
documentation for goods and services of the same type, explaining how its own product or 
services will differ. If the goods feature new technology and information regarding 
competing goods is not available, applicant must provide a detailed factual description of 
the goods. Factual information about the goods must make clear how they operate, salient 
features, and prospective customers and channels of trade.; and
 
(3)        Applicant must respond to the following questions: 
 
What is the meaning of the wording “SPLIT” in the applied-for mark in connection 
with applicant's goods? 
1. 
Do or will applicant's goods feature split lenses?  Please explain.
2. 
Do or will applicant's goods be able to provide more than one prescription within 
one pair of glasses?  Please explain. 
3. 
Do or will applicant's goods be bifocals?  Please explain. 
4. 
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§814, 1402.01(e).
 
If applicant submits webpage evidence to satisfy this requirement, applicant must provide (1) an image 
of the webpage, (2) the date it was accessed or printed, and (3) the complete URL address. In re ADCOIndus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 
1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018)); TMEP §710.01(b). Providing only a website address or hyperlink to the 
webpage is not sufficient to make the materials of record. In re ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 
USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (citing In re Olin Corp., 124 USPQ2d 1327, 1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB 
Solomon Assocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); TBMP §1208.03); TMEP §814.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
