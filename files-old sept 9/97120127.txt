SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Disclaimer Required
•
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the descriptive wording “STREET TACOS HAND CRAFTED” in the mark 
because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or 
use of applicant’s goods and/or services, and thus is an unregisterable component of the mark.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence indicated that "street tacos" is a common term used to describe a specific type of 
taco. Indeed, many websites use this term to differentiate different taco recipes.
 
Furthermore, applicant must disclaim the wording “HAND CRAFTED” because it is merely laudatory 
and descriptive of the alleged merit of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); 
DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1256, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1759 
(Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.03(k).
 
“Self-laudatory or puffing marks are regarded as a condensed form of describing the character or 
quality of the goods [or services].”  DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d at 
1256, 103 USPQ2d at 1759 (quoting In re The Boston Beer Co., 198 F.3d 1370, 1373, 53 USPQ2d 
1056, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1999)).  Thus, wording such as “ultimate,” “best,” “greatest,” and the like are 
generally considered laudatory and descriptive of an alleged superior quality of the goods and/or 
services.  See In re Nett Designs, Inc., 236 F.3d 1339, 1342, 57 USPQ2d 1564, 1566 (Fed. Cir. 2001); 
In re The Boston Beer Co., 198 F.3d at 1373-74, 53 USPQ2d at 1058-59; TMEP §1209.03(k).
 
The attached dictionary evidence shows this wording  means made by hand and not machine.  
Therefore, this wording is merely laudatory of the supposed superior quality of the goods and/or 
services.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “STREET TACOS HAND CRAFTED” apart 
from the mark as shown.
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding. 
 
Please email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.  
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 26, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120127
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
