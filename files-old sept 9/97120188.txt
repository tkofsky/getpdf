NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
NOTICE:The Office is in receipt of applicant's Preliminary Amendment dated Dec. 2, 2021.  The amended ID 
classification is made of record.  
 
NO CONFLICTING MARKS: 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS: 
 
Class 14 - 
 
In Class 14, applicant's identification is: “Watches; clocks; chronometric apparatus and instruments; 
articles of jewellery, articles of imitation jewellery; cases for watches, cases for clocks, cases for 
jewellery; bands, boxes, casings, chains, clasps, dials, faces, fobs, hands, movements, pouches, springs, 
straps, winders, all for watches; boxes, cabinets, dials, faces, hands, housings, mechanisms, 
movements, all for clocks; boxes and clasps for jewellery; key chains, key fobs, key rings; replacement 
parts and fittings for all the aforesaid.”  
 
The following wording is unacceptable:
 
"Articles of jewellery, articles of imitation jewellery" are indefinite.  The common commercial name of 
the jewelry and imitation jewelry articles must be stated.  See below for suggestions.  
 
"Cases for watches, cases for clocks" are indefinite.  It is unclear that these cases are clock and watches 
parts and watch-making and clock-making parts rather than containers for clocks and watches and 
containers for watch-making and clock-making.  Clarification is required.  See below for suggestions.   
 
"Key fobs" is indefinite and falls in multiple classes.  The type of key fobs must be stated.  See below 
for suggestions.  
 
"Casings . . for watches" is indefinite for the same reasons as discussed with regard to "cases for 
watches".  See below for suggestions.  
 
"Mechanisms" is indefinite.  More specificity is required.  The common commercial name of the 
mechanisms must be stated.  See below for suggestion.  
 
Taking the above together, applicant may adopt the following:
 
Class 9: Electronic key fobs being remote control apparatus 
 
Class 14: Watches; clocks; chronometric apparatus and instruments; articles of jewellery and imitation 
jewellery, namely, jewelry and imitation jewelry; cases being parts of watches and clocks; cases 
adapted for holding watches and clocks; cases for jewellery; bands, boxes, chains, clasps, dials, faces, 
fobs, hands, movements, pouches, springs, straps, and winders, all for watches; boxes, cabinets, dials, 
faces, hands, housings, mechanism parts, and movements, all for clocks; boxes and clasps for 
jewellery; key chains; decorative key fobs; key rings; replacement parts and fittings for all theaforesaid
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.  
 
Applicant's goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTI-CLASS REQUIREMENTS: 
 
The application identifies goods in more than one international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy 
all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act Section 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee already paid (view 
the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that are 
classified in at least 2 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only 1 class.  
Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or 
restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
FEES FOR ADDITIONAL CLASSES: 
 
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120188
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
