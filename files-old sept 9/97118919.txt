NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 22, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Search ResultsThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Specimen is not an acceptable webpage display. Registration is refused because the specimen in 
International Class(es) 5 is not acceptable as a display associated with the goods and does not show the 
applied-for mark as actually used in commerce. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §2.56(a), (b)(1); see TMEP §§904, 904.03(g)-(i), 904.07(a). An application based on 
Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in 
commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application or amendment to allege 
use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
A webpage or catalog display specimen (1) must show use of the mark directly associated with the 
goods and (2) such use must be of a point-of-sale nature. 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1). This means that this 
type of display specimen must include the following:
 
(1)        A picture or sufficient textual description of the goods;
 
(2)        The mark associated with the goods; and
 
(3)        A means for ordering the goods such as a “shopping cart” button/link, an 
order form, or a telephone number for placing orders.
 
See In re Sones, 590 F.3d 1282, 1286-89, 93 USPQ2d 1118, 1122-24 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re Azteca 
Sys., Inc., 102 USPQ2d 1955, 1957-58 (TTAB 2012); In re Dell Inc., 71 USPQ2d 1725, 1727 (TTAB 
2004); Lands’ End v. Manbeck, 797 F. Supp. 511, 514, 24 USPQ2d 1314, 1316 (E.D. Va. 1992); 
TMEP §904.03(h), (i)-.03(i)(D).
 
In this case, the specimen does not show sufficient means for ordering the goods. Specifically, there is 
no “shopping cart” button/link, order form, or  telephone number for placing orders  visible on the 
webpage.
 
Accordingly, such material is mere advertising, which is not acceptable as a specimen for goods. See In 
re Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 265039, at *15-16 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re Siny Corp., 
920 F.3d 1331, 1336, 2019 USPQ2d 127099, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. 2019)); see also Avakoff v. S. Pac. Co., 
765 F.2d 1097, 1098, 226 USPQ 435, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §904.04(b), (c).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  As specified above, a webpage specimen submitted as a display associated 
with the goods must show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and 
include information necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), 
(c).  Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL 
and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the 
specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed 
response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for eachapplicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Mark Differs on Drawing and Specimen
 
Mark shown on drawing does not match mark on specimen. Registration is refused because the 
specimen does not show the mark in the drawing in use in commerce in International Class(es) 5, which 
is required in the application or amendment to allege use. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). The mark 
appearing on the specimen and in the drawing must match; that is, the mark in the drawing “must be a 
substantially exact representation of the mark” on the specimen. See 37 C.F.R. §2.51(a)-(b); TMEP 
§807.12(a).
 
In this case, the specimen displays the mark as Le' Guardian. However, the drawing displays the mark 
as Le' Guardian and design. The mark on the specimen does not match the mark in the drawing because 
the design element does not appear on the specimen. Applicant has thus failed to provide the required 
evidence of use of the mark in commerce. See TMEP §807.12(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) for each 
applicable international class that (a) shows the mark in the drawing in actual use in 
commerce for the goods and/or services in the application or amendment to allege use, and 
(b) was in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or 
prior to the filing of an amendment to allege use.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with apicture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or 
advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(2)        Submit a request to amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 
1(b) (which includes withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no 
specimen is required before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) 
and filing requirements such as providing a specimen.
 
The USPTO will not accept an amended drawing submitted in response to this refusal because the 
changes would materially alter the drawing of the mark in the original application or as previously 
acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b); TMEP §807.14. Specifically, deletion of the design 
element would create a mark with a different overall commercial impression.
 
For more information about drawings and instructions on how to satisfy these response options using 
the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Drawing webpage.
 
Color Claim
 
Applicant must clarify whether color is being claimed as a feature of the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 
2.52(b)(1), 2.61(b); TMEP §§807.07(a) et seq. The drawing shows the mark in particular colors; 
however, the color claim indicate(s) that the colors can vary or change such that the mark may be used 
in color combinations different from those shown on the drawing.
 
An applicant may seek registration of only one mark in a single application. 37 C.F.R. §2.52; TMEP 
§807.01; see 15 U.S.C. §1051; In re Int’l Flavors & Fragrances Inc., 183 F.3d 1361, 1366, 51 USPQ2d 
1513, 1516-17 (Fed. Cir. 1999); In re Hayes, 62 USPQ2d 1443, 1445-46 (TTAB 2002). A mark with a 
changeable or “phantom” element such as varying or changing colors is generally considered to be 
more than one mark. See In re Hayes, 62 USPQ2d at 1445. In addition to the requirement to select one 
mark, the colors in the drawing of the mark, color claim, and description must match. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.52(b)(1); TMEP §§807.07 et seq.
 
Applicant may clarify whether color is a feature of the mark by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)       If applicant is not limiting the application to particular colors, applicant 
must submit a (a) new drawing of the mark in black and white only, with no other colors, 
(b) statement authorizing deletion of any color claim, if appropriate, and (c) description of 
the literal and design elements in the mark that omits any reference to color. A registration 
for a mark with a black-and-white drawing covers depictions of the mark in all possible 
color combinations and is not limited to any particular color scheme. See In re DataPackaging Corp., 453 F.2d 1300, 1302, 172 USPQ 396, 397 (C.C.P.A. 1972); TMEP 
§807.14(e)(i). In this case, amending the mark to delete color would not be considered a 
material alteration; however, any other amendments to the drawing will not be accepted if 
they would materially alter the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.72; see TMEP §§807.07(c), 807.14 et 
seq.
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate:
 
The mark consists of the stylized wording "Le' Guardian" next to a silhouette of a 
woman.
 
(2)       If applicant is limiting the application to particular colors, applicant must 
submit a (a) new drawing showing the mark in the specific colors for which registration is 
sought, or confirmation that the original drawing shows the mark for which registration is 
sought, and (b) an amended color claim that deletes the reference changeable or varying 
colors and restricts the color claim and description to only those colors in the new or 
original drawing, as appropriate. Generic color names must be used to describe the colors 
in the mark, e.g., red, yellow, blue. TMEP §807.07(a)(i)-(ii). If black, white, and/or gray 
represent background, outlining, shading, and/or transparent areas and are not part of the 
mark, applicant must so specify in the description. See TMEP §807.07(d).
 
The following color claim and description are suggested, if accurate:
 
Color claim: “The colors magenta is claimed as a feature of the mark.”
 
Description: “The mark consists of the stylized wording "Le' Guardian" in 
magenta next to a silhouette of a woman in magenta.
 
See TMEP §807.07(a)(i)-(ii).

description online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Drawing 
webpage.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that

number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
