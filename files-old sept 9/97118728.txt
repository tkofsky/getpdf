NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.

Section 2(d) Refusal-Likelihood of Confusion
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration No. 5213592 and 6732324.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); seeTMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”).  In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.”  In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis:  (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services.  See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01. 
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or 
services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer.  See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  
Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the 
registrant.  TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
In the present case, the applicant's mark is HUMAN NATURE DESIGNS, in standard characters, for 
"On-line retail and wholesale store services in the field of camping mugs, travel mugs, patches, pins, 
keychains, stickers, hats, calendars, pins, souvenirs and computerized on-line ordering featuring general 
consumer merchandise" in International Class 35 and "Artwork design services, graphic arts design, 
graphic design, and illustration in the field of marketing for others" in International Class 42. 
 
The registered marks are:
 
HUMAN NATURE (Registration No. 5213592) with design, used in connection with "Baby lotion; 
Baby oil; Blush; Body butter; Body scrub; Body wash; Cleansing milk; Essential oils; Eyeshadow; 
Face oils; Foot deodorant spray; Foundation; Foundation make-up; Hair masks; Hair wax; Hair 
conditioner; Hair oils; Hair shampoo; Hand creams; Hand soaps; Lip balm; Lip gloss; Lipstick; Loose 
face powder; Massage oil; Night cream; Baby shampoo; Bar soap; Body lotion; Dishwasher detergents; 
Essential oils for household use; Face powder; Facial cleansers; Facial masks; Facial cream; Facial 
washes; Laundry detergent; Non-medicated feminine hygiene wash; Non-medicated hair serums; Non-
medicated herbal body care products, namely, body oils, salves, and lip balms; Pet shampoo; Skin 
moisturizer; Skin toners" in International Class 003 and "Spray sanitizer for personal use" in 
International Class 005.HUMANATURE (Registration No. 6732324) in standard characters, used in connection with "Retail 
store services featuring outerwear, clothing, apparel, headwear, footwear and fashion accessories; 
online retail store services featuring outerwear, clothing, apparel, headwear, footwear and fashion 
accessories." in International Class 35.
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant: similarity of the marks, similarity of the goods 
and services, and similarity of trade channels of the goods and services.  See In re Opus One, Inc., 60 
USPQ2d 1812 (TTAB 2001); In re Dakin’s Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d 1593 (TTAB 1999); In re 
Azteca Rest. Enters., Inc., 50 USPQ2d 1209 (TTAB 1999); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. 
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
The applicant's mark is similar to the registered marks because they all contain the identical dominant 
first terms, HUMAN and NATURE, making the marks similar in sound, appearance, and commercial 
impression.Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any 
trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 
1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between 
VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a 
‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 
Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) 
(finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because 
“consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial 
words is particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”).  
 
Although the applicant's mark contains the additional term DESIGNS, this term is descriptive of the 
applicant's design services. Thus, consumers encountering the marks in relation to the goods and 
services would reasonably believe that the goods and services emanate from the same common 
source. Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant 
or dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 
128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 
1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Matter that is descriptive of or 
generic for a party’s goods and/or services is typically less significant or less dominant in relation to 
other wording in a mark. See Anheuser-Busch, LLC v. Innvopak Sys. Pty Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1816, 
1824-25 (TTAB 2015) (citing In re Chatam Int’l Inc., 380 F.3d 1340, 1342-43, 71 USPQ2d 1944, 1946 
(Fed. Cir. 2004)).  
 
In the present case, the applicant's services include design services, thus, DESIGNS merely describes a 
key feature of applicant's services. Thus, this wording is less significant in terms of affecting the mark's 
commercial impression, and renders the wording HUMAN NATURE the more dominant element ofthe mark.
 
Although Registration No. 5213592 (HUMAN NATURE) contains stylized lettering and a design 
element, namely a tilted heart in between the stylized terms HUMAN and NATURE, the registrant's 
use of stylized lettering and a heart design in between the terms does not alter the overall similar 
commercial impressions between the marks because the wording HUMAN NATURE appears in bold 
letters prominently in the registrant's mark and is the dominant element in both marks. Although marks 
are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in creating 
a commercial impression. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 
1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. 
Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Greater weight is often given to this dominant feature 
when determining whether marks are confusingly similar. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d at 
1305, 128 USPQ2d at 1050 (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d at 1407, 41 USPQ2d at 1533-
34). Accordingly, the word portions of the applicant's and registrant's marks are similar in appearance, 
sound, and commercial impression and the stylization and design in the registrant's mark does not 
obviate the similarity of the marks.
 
In addition, the dominant terms in applicant's mark and the only terms in  Registration No. 6732324 are 
HUMAN NATURE. Although registrant's mark appears as a compound word with no space separating 
the words and only one letter "N", that is, HUMANATURE; and the dominant elements in applicant's 
mark appears as multiple words with space separating the words, that is, HUMAN NATURE, this does 
not obviate the similarity between the marks because the marks are similar in sound and 
appearance and are thus confusingly similar for the purposes of determining likelihood of 
confusion. See, e.g., Seaguard Corp. v. Seaward Int’l, Inc., 223 USPQ 48, 51 (TTAB 1984) (“[T]he 
marks ‘SEAGUARD’ and ‘SEA GUARD’ are, in contemplation of law, identical [internal citation 
omitted].”); In re Best W. Family Steak House, Inc., 222 USPQ 827, 827 (TTAB 1984) (“There can be 
little doubt that the marks [BEEFMASTER and BEEF MASTER] are practically identical”); Stock Pot, 
Inc., v. Stockpot Rest., Inc., 220 USPQ 52, 52 (TTAB 1983), aff’d 737 F.2d 1576, 222 USPQ 665 (Fed. 
Cir. 1984) (“There is no question that the marks of the parties [STOCKPOT and STOCK POT] are 
confusingly similar. The word marks are phonetically identical and visually almost identical.”). 
 
For the reasons discussed above, the applicant’s mark is confusingly similar to the registered mark.  
 
Relatedness of the Goods/Services
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).The applicant's services are "On-line retail and wholesale store services in the field of camping mugs, 
travel mugs, patches, pins, keychains, stickers, hats, calendars, pins, souvenirs and computerized on-
line ordering featuring general consumer merchandise" in International Class 35 and "Artwork design 
services, graphic arts design, graphic design, and illustration in the field of marketing for others" in 
International Class 42. 
 
The goods in Registration No. 5213592 are "Baby lotion; Baby oil; Blush; Body butter; Body scrub; 
Body wash; Cleansing milk; Essential oils; Eyeshadow; Face oils; Foot deodorant spray; Foundation; 
Foundation make-up; Hair masks; Hair wax; Hair conditioner; Hair oils; Hair shampoo; Hand creams; 
Hand soaps; Lip balm; Lip gloss; Lipstick; Loose face powder; Massage oil; Night cream; Baby 
shampoo; Bar soap; Body lotion; Dishwasher detergents; Essential oils for household use; Face 
powder; Facial cleansers; Facial masks; Facial cream; Facial washes; Laundry detergent; Non-
medicated feminine hygiene wash; Non-medicated hair serums; Non-medicated herbal body care 
products, namely, body oils, salves, and lip balms; Pet shampoo; Skin moisturizer; Skin toners" in 
International Class 003 and "Spray sanitizer for personal use" in International Class 005. 
 
The goods in Registration No. 6732324 are "Retail store services featuring outerwear, clothing, apparel, 
headwear, footwear and fashion accessories; online retail store services featuring outerwear, clothing, 
apparel, headwear, footwear and fashion accessories" in International Class 35. 
 
The applicant's retail services include general consumer merchandise which includes the goods in the 
registered marks.The use of similar marks on or in connection with both products and retail-store 
services has been held likely to cause confusion where the evidence showed that the retail-store 
services featured the same type of products. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 
USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding the use of similar marks for various clothing items, 
including athletic uniforms, and for retail shops featuring sports team related clothing and apparel 
likely to cause confusion); In re Country Oven, Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 443903, at *12 (TTAB 2019) 
(holding the use of identical marks for bread buns and retail bakery stores and shops likely to cause 
confusion); In re House Beer, LLC, 114 USPQ2d 1073, 1078 (TTAB 2015) (holding the use of 
identical marks for beer and for retail store services featuring beer likely to cause confusion); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(ii).
 
In addition, the attached Internet evidence, consisting of third-party websites, establishes that the same 
entity commonly manufactures, produces, and provides the relevant goods and services and markets the 
goods and services under the same mark.  Applicant's and registrants' goods and services are likely to 
be encountered together in the marketplace by consumers and consumers would mistakenly believe that 
the goods and services originate from a common source.  Thus, the goods and services are considered 
related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 
1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 
2009).
 
As discussed above, the applicant’s mark is similar to the registered marks, and the goods and services 
are related. Accordingly, there would be a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the goods and 
services.  Registration of the mark is therefore refused under Trademark Act Section 2(d).
 
Although applicant's mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusals by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirements set forth below.Prior-Pending Application 
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 90810032 precedes applicant's filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant's mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant's response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application. 
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant's election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
While no response is required for the above issue at this time, the applicant must respond to the 
following:
 
Specimen Refusal- International Class 42
 
Specimen does not show use of the mark in commerce. Registration is refused because the specimen 
does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in International Class 42. Trademark 
Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of services 
identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Specifically, the submitted specimen pages show options to purchase goods on the applicant's 
website, but the specimen pages do not reference, advertise, or show the rendering of the 
applicant's design services in International Class 42. Therefore, the specimens are unacceptable because 
they do not show the applied-for mark used in commerce  in connection with any of the applicant's 
services in International Class 42. 
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).  Any webpage printout or 
screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or 
printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified 
statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); 
TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual use 
in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the 
services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified substitutespecimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in a 
signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce 
at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the 
amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this 
statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing 
an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before 
publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, 
including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Disclaimer Requirement
 
Applicant has disclaimed the entire applied-for mark; however, an entire mark may not be disclaimed. 
TMEP §1213.06; see 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Dena Corp. v. Belvedere Int’l Inc., 950 F.2d 1555, 
1560, 21 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 1991); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 n.1 
(TTAB 2001). Accordingly, the disclaimer is not accepted and will not be entered into the USPTO’s 
database. See TMEP §714.05(a).
 
However, applicant must disclaim the wording “DESIGNS” because it is merely descriptive of a 
function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant's services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 
2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
Applicant's services are "Artwork design services, graphic arts design, graphic design, and illustration 
in the field of marketing for others", thus, DESIGNS merely describes the key function, feature, 
purpose or use of applicant's services and must be disclaimed. 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “DESIGNS” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118728
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
