Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Identification of Goods and Services – Amendment Required 
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “Commercialization, namely, mediation and procurement of 
contracts for the purchase and sale of fresh avocado for third parties, purchase, sale, import and export 
of fresh fruits, namely, fresh avocado for third parties; business management, decoration of sideboards 
and showcases, namely, shop window dressing, product demonstration and exhibitions, namely, 
product demonstration services in shop windows by live models and organization of trade show 
exhibitions for promoting sales of fresh avocado” in the identification of services in Class 035 and the 
wording "Fresh avocado packer and distributor" in the identification of services in Class 039 because it 
is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is 
indefinite because the nature of the services is not clear. Further, this wording could identify services in 
more than one international class. For example, "import and export" could encompass "Import and 
export agencies in the field of fresh avocados for third parties" in Class 035 or "Import and export 
services, namely, transportation of merchandise of others in the nature of fresh avocados" in Class 039. 
 
Applicant may adopt the wording below, if accurate. Suggested amendments are in bold text. Where 
bold text appears without any instructions, the applicant should note that the wording is indefinite 
and/or overly broad and the suggested amendment in bold appears to accurately describe the services. If 
any of the examining attorney’s suggestions are not accurate, applicant is still required to amend the 
unacceptable wording to identify definite and properly classified services
 
International Class 031: Acceptable as filed
•
 
International 
Class 
035: 
Product commercialization 
services, 
namely, mediation 
and 
procurement of contracts for the purchase and sale of fresh avocados for third parties; Import and 
export agencies in the field of fresh avocados for third parties; Business management services 
in the field of sales of fresh avocados; Decoration of sideboards and showcases, namely, shop 
window dressing; Product demonstration and exhibitions, namely, product demonstration 
services in shop windows by live models and organization of trade show exhibitions for 
promoting sales of fresh avocado  
•
 
International Class 039: Warehousing services, namely, packing and distribution of fresh 
avocados; Import and export services, namely, transportation of merchandise of others in 
•the nature of fresh avocados 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e). Additionally, for U.S. applications filed under Trademark Act 
Section 44(e), the scope of the identification for purposes of permissible amendments may not exceed 
the scope of the goods and/or services identified in the foreign registration.  37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
Marmark, Ltd. v. Nutrexpa, S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845 (TTAB 1989) (citing In re Löwenbräu 
München, 175 USPQ 178, 181 (TTAB 1972)); TMEP §§1012, 1402.01(b).  
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Translation of Foreign Wording in the Mark Required 
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must submit an English translation of the 
foreign wording in the mark. 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(9), 2.61(b); see TMEP §809. The following is 
suggested: The English translation of “AGUACATES” in the mark is “AVOCADOS”. TMEP 
§809.03. See attached translation evidence. To respond to this requirement for information, open the 
appropriate Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form and enter the serial 
number, answer “yes” to question 3, and provide the information on the “Additional Statement(s)” page 
in the “Translation” text box(es) in the form.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
Disclaimer of Descriptive Wording Required 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “AGUACATES” because it is merely descriptive of an 
ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or 
services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
Non-English wording that is merely descriptive, deceptively misdescriptive, geographically descriptive, 
generic, or informational in connection with the identified goods and/or services, is an unregistrable 
component of the mark that is subject to disclaimer. TMEP §§1213.03(a), 1213.08(d); see Bausch & 
Lomb Optical Co. v. Overseas Fin. & Trading Co., 112 USPQ 6, 8 (Comm’r Pats. 1956). The 
disclaimer must refer to the actual non-English wording that appears in the mark, not the English 
translation of that wording. TMEP §1213.08(d).
 
The attached evidence from Google Translate shows this wording means AVOCADOS.  The wording 
AVOCADOS appears in applicant's identification of services.Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “AGUACATES” apart from the mark as 
shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
Dual Bases - Option to Delete Section 1(b) Basis 
 
The application specifies both an intent to use basis under Trademark Act Section 1(b) and reliance on 
a foreign registration(s) under Section 44(e). See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 1126(e); 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2)-
(3). However, the foreign registration alone may serve as a basis for obtaining a U.S. registration. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3); TMEP §806.01(d). If applicant wants to rely solely on the foreign registration 
under Section 44(e) as the basis, applicant can request deletion of the Section 1(b) basis. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.35(b)(1); TMEP §806.04.
 
Unless applicant indicates otherwise, the USPTO will presume that applicant is relying on both 
Sections 1(b) and 44(e). Thus, although the mark may be approved for publication, it will not register 
until an acceptable allegation of use has been filed for the goods and/or services based on Section 1(b).
 
Response Guidelines
 
For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal and/or requirement in this 
Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and evidence against the refusal,

additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
