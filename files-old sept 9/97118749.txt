below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 22, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKSThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks

U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Request for Information - Foreign Applicant With U.S. Address
•
Identification of Services Requires Amendment
•
 
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - FOREIGN APPLICANT WITH U.S. ADDRESS
 
Applicant must clarify its U.S. domicile address or appoint a qualified U.S.-licensed attorney. 
TMEP §601.01(b); see 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.61(b). Clarification is required because an applicant 
whose domicile is located outside of the United States or its territories must be represented at the 
USPTO by an attorney who is an active member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a 
U.S. state or territory. 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); TMEP §601.01(a). U.S.-domiciled applicants, however, are 
not required to be represented. TMEP §601.01(b).
 
A domicile address must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place 
an individual applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal 
place of business, which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as an individual of India and specifies a U.S. street 
address as applicant’s domicile. It is unclear from the record whether the U.S. street address provided is 
the place applicant resides and intends to be applicant’s principal home.
 
Response options. Applicant must (1) provide documentation to support the referenced U.S. street 
address or (2) appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney qualified to practice under 37 C.F.R. §11.14 as its 
representative, before the application may proceed to registration. 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.61(b); TMEP 
§601.01(b). See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information.
 
To provide documentation supporting applicant’s U.S. domicile. Applicant must provide 
documentation showing the name and listed domicile address of the individual, for example one of the 
following: (1) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement; (2) a current, valid 
homeowner’s, renter’s, or motor vehicle insurance policy; or (3) a computer-generated bill issued by a 
utility company dated no earlier than 60 days before the application filing date. TMEP §601.01(b); see 
37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.61(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed domicile address, 
and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) 
response form and enter the serial number, answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional 
Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, click the button below the text box to 
attach documentation to support the U.S. street address.
 
To appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney in this application, applicant should submit a completed TEAS 
Change Address or Representation form. The newly-appointed attorney must submit a TEAS Response 
to Examining Attorney Office Action form indicating that an appointment of attorney has been made 
and address all other refusals or requirements in this action, if any. Alternatively, if applicant retains an 
attorney before filing the response, the attorney can respond to this Office action by using theappropriate TEAS response form and provide his or her attorney information in the form and sign it as 
applicant’s attorney. See 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b)(1)(ii); TMEP §604.01.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES REQUIRES AMENDMENT 
 
The identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because the proper nomenclature for 
specifying software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service includes the word "services" after the 
preamble. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate:
 
Class 42: Software as a service (SaaS) and Platform as a service (PaaS) services featuring software for 
use in software and application development.
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e). 7
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.

The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118749
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
