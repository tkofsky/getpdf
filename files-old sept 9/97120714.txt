The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 22, 2022The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Prior-pending Application
•
Section 2(d) Refusal for Likelihood of Confusion
•
 
PRIOR-PENDING APPLICATION
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 97120427 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL FOR LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 1997604, 6152828, 6653545, and 4346291. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registrations.
 
Applicant's applied-for mark is BESTCHOICELIGHT in standard characters for "Chandeliers; Air 
purifying apparatus; Automotive lighting headlights for vehicles; Ceiling lights; Cooking stoves; Desk 
lamps; Flood lights; Floor lamps; LED lamps; Lighting devices for showcases; Lighting fixtures; 
Lighting tubes; Lights for use in growing plants; Solar powered lamps; Wall lamps" in International 
Class 11.

The mark in U.S. Registration No. 6152828 is BEST CHOICE PRODUCTS in standard characters for, 
in relevant part, "Air Fryers; Air fryer cooking ovens; electric coffee makers; electric pressure cookers; 
Sous vides machines; electric toasters; electric crepe makers; Electric kettles; electric deep fryers; Ice 
machines; portable fire pits" in International Class 11, and "Furniture; Office furniture; Outdoor 
furniture; Furniture for house, office and garden; Office desks; Reclining chairs; Ergonomic chairs for 
use in seated massages; Ottomans; Tables; Occasional tables; Folding tables; Display tables; Dining 
tables; Furniture made from wood or substitutes for wood; Furniture made from wood or substitutes for

in relevant part, "Log racks in the nature of storage racks for firewood; Bathroom vanity mirrors; 
Armoires; Work benches; Potting benches; Umbrella stands; Bed frames; Furniture; Fireplace screens" 
in International Class 20. 
 
The mark in U.S. Registration No. 4346291 is BEST CHOICE PRODUCTS in standard characters for 
"Online retail store services featuring a wide variety of consumer goods" in International Class 35. 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
Applicant's applied-for mark is BESTCHOICELIGHT.  The mark in U.S. Registration No. 1997604 is 
BEST CHOICE.  The mark in U.S. Registration No. 6152828 is BEST CHOICE PRODUCTS.  The 
mark in U.S. Registration No. 6653545 is BESTCHOICEPRODUCTS.  The mark in U.S. Registration 
No. 4346291 is BEST CHOICE PRODUCTS.  Here, the marks share similar wording BESTCHOICE- 
and/or BEST CHOICE.
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
In the present case, the marks share similar wording BESTCHOICE- and/or BEST CHOICE.  Marks 
may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms orphrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker 
Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub 
nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 
USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly 
similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and 
CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
The additional wording in the applicant's mark, -LIGHT, does not obviate the similarity because it is 
generic for the lighting goods, and thus consumers will look to the other wording in the mark to 
determine the source BESTCHOICE-.  Also, regarding U.S. Registration Nos. 6152828, 6653545, 
and 4346291, the additional wording in the registrant's marks, PRODUCTS or -PRODUCTS, does not 
obviate the similarity because it is generic for the goods, and thus consumers will look to the other 
wording in the mark to determine the source BEST CHOICE or BESTCHOICE-.  Although marks are 
compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in creating a 
commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. 
Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or generic for a party’s goods and/or 
services is typically less significant or less dominant when comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 
903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 
F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).   
 
Finally, where the goods and/or services of an applicant and registrant are “similar in kind and/or 
closely related,” the degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding of likelihood 
of confusion is not as great as in the case of diverse goods and/or services.  In re J.M. Originals Inc., 6 
USPQ2d 1393, 1394 (TTAB 1987); see Shen Mfg. Co. v. Ritz Hotel Ltd., 393 F.3d 1238, 1242, 73 
USPQ2d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2004); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar. 
 
Relatedness of the Goods and/or Services
 
In re U.S. Registration No. 1997604
 
Applicant's goods are for "Chandeliers; Air purifying apparatus; Automotive lighting headlights for 
vehicles; Ceiling lights; Cooking stoves; Desk lamps; Flood lights; Floor lamps; LED lamps; Lighting 
devices for showcases; Lighting fixtures; Lighting tubes; Lights for use in growing plants; Solar 
powered lamps; Wall lamps" in International Class 11.
 
The goods in U.S. Registration No. 1997604 are for, in relevant part, "Electric light bulbs" in 
International Class 11. 
 
Here, applicant's and registrant's goods are related.  For instance, applicant's and registrant's lighting 
goods are related. 
 
The compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surroundingtheir marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods] emanate from 
the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 
1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 
2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
For example, the attached Internet evidence consists of website screenshots from GE, Philips, and 
Samsung, which provides lighting devices for showcases, lighting fixtures, and/or lighting tubes, as 
well as electric light bulbs.  This evidence establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, 
produces, or provides the relevant goods and markets the goods under the same mark.  Thus, 
applicant’s and registrant’s goods are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, 
e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. 
Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
In re U.S. Registration No. 6152828
 
Applicant's goods are for "Chandeliers; Air purifying apparatus; Automotive lighting headlights for 
vehicles; Ceiling lights; Cooking stoves; Desk lamps; Flood lights; Floor lamps; LED lamps; Lighting 
devices for showcases; Lighting fixtures; Lighting tubes; Lights for use in growing plants; Solar 
powered lamps; Wall lamps" in International Class 11. 
 
The goods in U.S. Registration No. 6152828 are for, in relevant part, "Air Fryers; Air fryer cooking 
ovens; electric coffee makers; electric pressure cookers; Sous vides machines; electric toasters; electric 
crepe makers; Electric kettles; electric deep fryers; Ice machines; portable fire pits" in International 
Class 11, and "Furniture; Office furniture; Outdoor furniture; Furniture for house, office and garden; 
Office desks; Reclining chairs; Ergonomic chairs for use in seated massages; Ottomans; Tables; 
Occasional tables; Folding tables; Display tables; Dining tables; Furniture made from wood or 
substitutes for wood; Furniture made from wood or substitutes for wood, including coffee tables made 
of wood; Sofas; Futons; Accent pillows; Benches; Outdoor benches; Lounge chairs; Reclining chairs; 
wicker outdoor furniture; wicker outdoor furniture, namely, sofas, tables and chairs; cushions for 
outdoor furniture; wicker furniture, namely, tables and chairs; Baker's racks; Kitchen baker's racks 
made of metal; Patio furniture; Porch swings; Hammock stands; swing chairs" in International Class 
20. 
 
Here, applicant's and registrant's goods are related.  For instance, applicant's cooking and lighting 
goods and registrant's cooking and furniture goods are related.
 
For example, the attached Internet evidence consists of website screenshots from GE, KitchenAid, and 
Wolf, which provides cooking stoves and electric coffee makers.  Additionally, the attached Internet 
evidence consists of website screenshots from Restoration Hardware, West Elm, and Anthropologie, 
which provides floor lamps, wall lamps, and furniture.  This evidence establishes that the same entity 
commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant goods and markets the goods under the 
same mark.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are considered related for likelihood of confusion 
purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re 
Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
In re U.S. Registration No. 6653545
 
Applicant's goods are for "Chandeliers; Air purifying apparatus; Automotive lighting headlights for 
vehicles; Ceiling lights; Cooking stoves; Desk lamps; Flood lights; Floor lamps; LED lamps; Lightingdevices for showcases; Lighting fixtures; Lighting tubes; Lights for use in growing plants; Solar 
powered lamps; Wall lamps" in International Class 11. 
 
The goods in U.S. Registration No. 6653545 are for, in relevant part, "Log racks in the nature of 
storage racks for firewood; Bathroom vanity mirrors; Armoires; Work benches; Potting benches; 
Umbrella stands; Bed frames; Furniture; Fireplace screens" in International Class 20. 
 
Here, applicant's and registrant's goods are related.  For instance, applicant's lighting goods and 
registrant's furniture goods are related. 
 
For example, the attached Internet evidence consists of website screenshots from Restoration 
Hardware, West Elm, and Anthropologie, which provides floor lamps, wall lamps, and furniture.  This 
evidence establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant 
goods and markets the goods under the same mark.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are 
considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 
USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 
1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
In re U.S. Registration No. 4346291 
 
Applicant's goods are for "Chandeliers; Air purifying apparatus; Automotive lighting headlights for 
vehicles; Ceiling lights; Cooking stoves; Desk lamps; Flood lights; Floor lamps; LED lamps; Lighting 
devices for showcases; Lighting fixtures; Lighting tubes; Lights for use in growing plants; Solar 
powered lamps; Wall lamps" in International Class 11. 
 
The services in U.S. Registration No. 4346291 are for "Online retail store services featuring a wide 
variety of consumer goods" in International Class 35. 
 
Here, applicant's lighting goods and registrant's retail store services are related.
 
For example, the attached Internet evidence consists of website screenshots from Anthropologie, 
Philips, and Urban Outfitters, which provides applicant's lighting goods as well as online retail store 
services featuring a wide variety of consumer goods.  This evidence establishes that the same entity 
commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant goods and services and markets the goods 
and services under the same mark, or the relevant goods and services are sold or provided through the 
same trade channels and used by the same classes of consumers in the same fields of use.  Thus, 
applicant’s goods and registrant’s services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  
See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. 
Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Finally, the overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods 
and/or services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar 
mark by a newcomer. See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 
1993). Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of 
the registrant. TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
In summary, the applicant’s mark and registrants' marks create the same commercial impression andthe respective goods and/or services are highly related. Therefore, consumers are likely to be confused 
and mistakenly believe that these goods and/or services originate from a common source. Accordingly, 
registration must be refused under Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.

MARISSA M. ROSENBAUMUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120714
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
•
