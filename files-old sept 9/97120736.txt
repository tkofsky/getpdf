SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Identification of Goods
•
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
 
The identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified because applicant must specify the format 
and the function of the software. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must amend 
the identification to specify the common commercial or generic name of the goods. See TMEP 
§1402.01. If the goods have no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the 
product, its main purpose, and its intended uses. See id.
 
Applicant may adopt the following wording, if accurate: Downloadable mobile software application for 
use in providing personal and professional development coaching, and for use in providing articles, 
information, and events in the nature of livestream audio and videos consulting sessions in the field of 
coaching.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).  
 
Please note that the USPTO has the discretion to determine the degree of particularity needed to clearly 
identify goods and/or services covered by a mark. In re SICPA Holding, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *4 
(TTAB 2021) (quoting In re Omega SA, 494 F.3d 1362, 1365, 83 USPQ2d 1541, 1543-44 (Fed. Cir. 
2007)). Accordingly, the USPTO requires the description of goods and/or services in a U.S. application 
to be specific, definite, clear, accurate, and concise. In re tapio GmbH, 2020 USPQ2d 11387, at *6 
(TTAB 2020) (quoting In re Cordua Rests., Inc., 823 F.3d 594, 605, 118 USPQ2d 1632, 1639 (Fed. 
Circ. 2016)); TMEP §1402.01.Additionally, it is noted that identifications of goods and/or services 
determined acceptable in earlier-filed applications and registrations are not always acceptable when 
adopted in later-filed applications. See TMEP §§702.03(a)(iv), 1402.14. All identifications are 
examined in accordance with the Trademark Rules of Practice and the USPTO’s policies and 
procedures in effect on the filing date of the application; however, for Section 1 or 44 applications, an 
applicant may voluntarily choose to follow policies and procedures adopted after the filing date of the 
application. See 37 C.F.R. §2.85(e)(1)-(e)(2); TMEP §§1401.09, 1401.10, 1401.10(a), 1402.14.
 
The USPTO’s rules and policies with respect to identifications of goods and/or services are updated 
periodically to reflect changes in the marketplace and technology as well as changes to the international 
classification system. See TMEP §1402.14. For guidance on drafting acceptable identifications of 
goods and/or services, use the USPTO’s online U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services 
Manual, which is continually updated in accordance with prevailing rules and policies. See TMEP 
§1402.04.

Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP

however, emails can be used for informal communications and are included in the application record.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120736
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
