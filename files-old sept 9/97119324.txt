Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.

Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusal 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 6053238. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark CROESUS in standard characters for “Clothing, namely, 
shirts, jackets, pants, underwear” in International Class 25.
 
Registrant’s mark is KROCEUS in standard characters for “Bathing trunks; Down jackets; Dresses; 
Girdles; Head wear; Hosiery; Rain suits; Sandals; Scarfs; Short trousers; Ski jackets; Sleeping 
garments; Sports shoes; Underclothing; Wedding dresses; Wind-jackets; Wind coats; Women's 
clothing, namely, shirts, dresses, skirts, blouses; Working overalls” in International Class 25. 
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marksconfusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Here, applicant’s mark, CROESUS, is confusingly similar to the registered mark, KROCEUS. 
 
As will be discussed below, the goods of the applicant and the registrant are legally identical. Where 
the goods of an applicant and registrant are identical or virtually identical, the degree of similarity 
between the marks required to support a finding that confusion is likely declines. See Cai v. Diamond 
Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting In re Viterra Inc., 
671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.” 
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b). The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks. In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 
(TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP 
§1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 
2014).
 
In this case, applicant's mark CROESUS is a word with a definable meaning of "a very rich man." See 
attached evidence from Merriam-Webster Dictionary. It is likely that a consumer will presume the 
registered markKROCEUS is a novelty misspelling of "CROESUS." The two words are visually 
similar. "C" and "K" can both be pronounced in the same manner and so the initial syllable of the 
words is pronounced the name. Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, 
prefix, or syllable in any trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot 
Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) 
(finding similarity between VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because 
“VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on 
the label”); Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 
1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA 
in part because “consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic 
Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the 
marks’ two initial words is particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words 
first”).  
 
The second half of the words "ESUS" and "CEUS" are visually very similar as they both contain the 
letters "E" and "U" and end with the letter "S." It is likely that these marks would be pronounced 
similarly. Slight differences in the sound of similar marks will not avoid a likelihood of confusion. In re 
Energy Telecomms. & Elec. Ass’n, 222 USPQ 350, 351 (TTAB 1983); see In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1367, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1912 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
 
Because the marks look and sound similar and create the same commercial impression, the marks are 
considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.Relatedness of the Goods 
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods stated in the application 
and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 
F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 
1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the registration uses broad wording to describe underclothing, which presumably 
encompasses all goods of the type described, including applicant’s more narrow "underwear."  See, 
e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. 
Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015). Additionally, the applicant uses broad 
wording to describe "jackets," "pants," and "clothing, namely, shirts" which presumably encompasses 
all goods of the type described, including registrant's more narrow "down jackets," "ski jackets," "wind-
jackets," "short trousers," and "women's clothing, namely shirts." Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s 
goods are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) 
(citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 
(C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball 
Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
Accordingly, the goods  are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of confusion analysis. 
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods are legally identical, there is a likelihood of confusion as 
to the source of applicant’s goods, and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Trademark 
Act.
 
Mark is Merely Ornamental Feature of Clothing Refusal
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark as used on the specimen of record is merely a 
decorative or ornamental feature of applicant’s clothing and, thus, does not function as a trademark to 
indicate the source of applicant’s clothing and to identify and distinguish applicant’s clothing from 
others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1052, 1127; see In re Lululemon 
Athletica Can. Inc., 105 USPQ2d 1684, 1689 (TTAB 2013); In re Pro-Line Corp., 28 USPQ2d 1141, 
1142 (TTAB 1993); TMEP §§904.07(b), 1202.03 et seq.
 
The size, location, dominance, and significance of the alleged mark as used on the goods are all 
relevant factors in determining the commercial impression of the applied-for mark. See, e.g., In re 
Peace Love World Live, LLC, 127 USPQ2d 1400, 1403 (TTAB 2018) (quoting In re Hulting, 107 
USPQ2d 1175, 1178 (TTAB 2013)); In re Lululemon Athletica Can. Inc., 105 USPQ2d at 1687 
(quoting In re Right-On Co., 87 USPQ2d 1152, 1156 (TTAB 2008)); TMEP §1202.03(a).
 
With respect to clothing, consumers may recognize small designs or discrete wording as trademarks,rather than as merely ornamental features, when located, for example, on the pocket or breast area of a 
shirt. See TMEP §1202.03(a). Consumers may not, however, perceive larger designs or slogans as 
trademarks when such matter is prominently displayed across the front of a t-shirt. See In re Pro-Line 
Corp., 28 USPQ2d at 1142; In re Dimitri’s Inc., 9 USPQ2d 1666, 1667-68 (TTAB 1988); TMEP 
§1202.03(a), (b), (f)(i), (f)(ii).
 
In this case, the submitted specimen shows the applied-for mark, CROESUS, located directly on the 
front of t-shirts and the back of jackets, where ornamental elements often appear. See TMEP 
§1202.03(a), (b). Furthermore, the mark is displayed in a relatively large size on the clothing such that 
it dominates the overall appearance of the goods. While it appears that some of the marks from the 
specimens appear on the pocket area of the shirt, the mark on the clothing is either cut off so that the 
entirety of the mark cannot be read or the image is reversed so that the mark does not appear as it does 
in the drawing. Lastly, the applied-for mark appears to be a design element that is used in a merely 
decorative manner that would be perceived by consumers as having little or no particular source-
identifying significance.
 
Therefore, consumers would view the applied-for mark as a decorative or ornamental feature of the 
goods, rather than as a trademark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and to distinguish them 
from others.
 
In appropriate circumstances, applicant may overcome this refusal by satisfying one of the following 
options:
 
(1)       Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application (or prior to the 
filing of an amendment to allege use) and that shows proper trademark use for the 
identified goods in International Class 25. Examples of acceptable specimens that show 
non-ornamental use on clothing include hang tags and labels used inside a garment.
 
(2)       Amend to the Supplemental Register, which is a second trademark register 
for marks not yet eligible for registration on the Principal Register, but which may become 
capable over time of functioning as source indicators.
 
(3)       Claim acquired distinctiveness under Trademark Act Section 2(f) by 
submitting evidence that the applied-for mark has become distinctive of applicant’s goods; 
that is, proof that applicant’s extensive use and promotion of the mark allowed consumers 
now directly to associate the mark with applicant as the source of the goods.
 
(4)       Submit evidence that the applied-for mark is an indicator of secondary 
source; that is, proof that the mark is already recognized as a source indicator for other 
goods or services that applicant sells/offers.
 
(5)       Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b). This option will 
later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements.
