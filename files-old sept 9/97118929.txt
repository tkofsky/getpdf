NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Search ResultsThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Applicant's Entity Type
 
The names of at least two different individuals appear in the section of the application intended for the 
trademark owner’s name; however, the legal entity is set forth as a limited liability company. Applicant 
must clarify this inconsistency. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), (a)(3)(i)-(ii), 2.61(b); TMEP §803.03(d), 
(h).
 
If these individuals are applying together as joint owners/applicants, they must amend the legal entity 
from “limited liability company” to “individual” and each joint applicant must indicate his or her 
country of citizenship. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(i); TMEP §803.03(d). Alternatively, if applicant is a 
limited liability company, applicant must set forth its correct name and U.S. state or foreign country 
under whose laws it was established. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §803.03(h).
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration will be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).
 
Color Claim Required
 
Although applicant submitted a color drawing with a description referencing colors in the mark, 
applicant did not provide a list of all the colors claimed as a feature of the mark, known as a color 
claim. Therefore, applicant must provide this required color claim. 37 C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1); see TMEP 
§§807.07(a) et seq.
 
The following color claim is suggested, if accurate: “The colors brown and green are claimed as a 
feature of the mark.” TMEP §807.07(a)(i).
 
Unnecessary 2(f) Claim as to the Entire Mark
 
Applicant claims that the entire applied-for mark has acquired distinctiveness under Trademark Act 
Section 2(f); however, the mark appears to be inherently distinctive and is eligible for registration on 
the Principal Register without proof of acquired distinctiveness. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(f); TMEP 
§1212.02(d). As this Section 2(f) claim appears to be unnecessary, applicant has the option to withdraw 
this claim. See TMEP §1212.02(d).
 
Applicant may withdraw this claim by instructing the trademark examining attorney to delete it from 
the application record. See id. If applicant does not withdraw the claim, it will remain in the application 
record and be published on the registration certificate. See TMEP §1212.10.
 
A claim of acquired distinctiveness may be construed as a concession by applicant that the entire 
applied-for mark is not inherently distinctive. See Cold War Museum, Inc. v. Cold War Air Museum, 
Inc., 586 F.3d 1352, 1358, 92 USPQ2d 1626, 1629 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citing Yamaha Int’l Corp. v. 
Hoshino Gakki Co., 840 F.2d 1572, 1577, 6 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir. 1988)); TMEP 
§1212.02(b).Name of an Individual
 
Applicant’s statement regarding the name, portrait or signature of a living individual identified in the 
mark will not be published on any registration that may issue from this application. The statement is 
unnecessary because the mark on its face would not reasonably be perceived as the name or likeness of 
a specific living individual. TMEP §§813.01(b), 1206.05.
 
Translation
 
Applicant’s English translation of MELANINS BLEND in the application is unnecessary because 
these terms appear in an English dictionary. TMEP §809.01(b)(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(9). The 
USPTO will disregard the translation; it will not be published on any registration certificate that may 
issue from this application. TMEP §809.03.
 
Transliteration
 
The transliteration statement is unnecessary and will be deleted.
 
Stippling
 
The stippling statement is unnecessaryand will be deleted.
 
 Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for 
more information.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
