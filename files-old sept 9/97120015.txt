INTRODUCTION 
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
 
SEARCH RESULTS FROM USPTO DATABASE FOR CONFLICTING MARKS 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:  
Section 44(e) Refusal-- European Union Registration is Not from Applicant's Country of Origin 
•
Disclaimer Required 
•
Identification Amendment Required 
•
Clarification of Applicant's Entity Type Required 
•
 
 
SECTION 44(e) REFUSAL-- EUROPEAN UNION REGISTRATION IS NOT FROM 
APPLICANT'S COUNTRY OF ORIGIN 
 
Registration is refused under Trademark Act Section 44(e) because the European Union (EU) 
registration is not from applicant’s country of origin. See 15 U.S.C. §1126(e); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §1002.01. Under Section 44(c), “country of origin” is defined as the country in 
which an applicant (1) is domiciled, (2) has a bona fide and effective industrial or commercial 
establishment, or (3) is a national. 15 U.S.C. §1126(c); TMEP §1002.04.
 
Applicant submitted a trademark registration from the EU to support applicant’s Section 44(e) basis. 
On or after January 1, 2021, EU trademark registrations ceased covering the United Kingdom (UK). 
See Agreement on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU & the European Atomic Energy Cmty. arts. 
54-61, Dec. 11, 2019, 2019 O.J. (C 384) 1. However, the U.S. application indicates that applicant is 
domiciled and/or incorporated or organized in the UK and is not domiciled or incorporated or 
organized in a country in the EU. Therefore, applicant must establish that, as of the date of issuance of 
the EU registration, one of the remaining countries in the EU is applicant’s country of origin. See 15 
U.S.C. §1126(c); TMEP §1002.04.
 
To overcome this refusal, applicant may provide the following written statement for the record: 
“Applicant has had a bona fide and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the 
European Union as of the date of issuance of the foreign registration.” TMEP §1002.04. 
Alternatively, applicant may provide an active UK trademark registration for the same mark and goods 
or services. Further, if applicant cannot assert that an EU country is a country of origin or provide a UK 
trademark registration, applicant may delete the Section 44(e) basis and substitute Section 1(a) or 1(b), 
if applicant can satisfy all the requirements for the new basis. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(a)-(b), 1126(e); 37 
C.F.R. §2.35(b); TMEP §§806.03, 1002.01.
 
To amend an application to one based on a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce under 
Trademark Act Section 1(b), an applicant must provide the following statement, verified with an 
affidavit or signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “Applicant has a bona fide intention to use 
the mark in commerce and had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the 
application filing date.” See 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2).For more information about Section 1(b) basis requirements, and instructions on how to satisfy them 
online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, please go to the Basis 
webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “PARTNERS” because it merely designates the legal character or 
family business structure of an entity and does not indicate the source of applicant’s services. See 15 
U.S.C. §§1051-1053, 1127; In re Piano Factory Grp., Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1522, 1526 (TTAB 2006); In 
re Patent & Trademark Servs., Inc., 49 USPQ2d 1537, 1539-40 (TTAB 1998); TMEP §1213.03(d).
 
Business type designations and abbreviations such as “Corporation,” “Inc.,” “Company,” “LLC,” and 
“Ltd.” or family business designations such as “& Sons” or “Bros.” must be disclaimed, because they 
merely indicate applicant’s business type or structure and generally have no source-indicating capacity. 
TMEP §1213.03(d); see, e.g., Goodyear’s India Rubber Glove Mfg. Co. v. Goodyear Rubber Co., 128 
U.S. 598, 602-03 (1888); In re Piano Factory Grp., Inc., 85 USPQ2d at 1526; In re Patent & 
Trademark Servs., Inc., 49 USPQ2d at 1539-40.  
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “PARTNERS” apart from the mark as 
shown.
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
 
Applicant must additionally respond to the requirement below. 
 
 
IDENTIFICATION AMENDMENT REQUIRED 
 
Select entries in applicant's identification are indefinite because the wording is overly vague and the 
nature, use, or purpose of applicant's services is unclear. See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. Other entries 
are indefinite because the wording describes services in multiple International Classes. See TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.03. 
 
If accurate, applicant may adopt the following wording:
 
Class 36: Financial services, namely, {indicate specific financial services, e.g., financial 
restructuring services, money lending, financial portfolio analysis services}; financial 
management services; investment services, namely, {indicate specific, e.g., capital investment 
services, investment advisory services, investment banking services}; financial asset 
management services; hedge fund investment services; capital investment; debt advisoryservices; factoring agencies; financial analysis; financial appraisals in responding to calls for 
tenders; financial appraisals in responding to requests for proposals; financial consultancy; 
financial research; providing financial information; financing services; investment of funds; 
lending against security, namely, securities lending; loans financing; mutual funds services, 
namely, {indicate specific, e.g., mutual fund distribution, mutual fund brokerage, mutual 
fund investment}; provident fund services, namely, {indicate specific using common 
commercial name, e.g., individual retirement account services}; business liquidation services, 
financial; debt collection agency services; financial evaluation for insurance and banking 
purpose and of real estate; financial sponsorship of {indicate specific event or activity}; 
financial valuation of intellectual property assets; organisation of monetary collections, namely, 
{indicate specific using common commercial name, e.g., collection of money owed from 
settlements, debt collection agency services, collection of debts}; trusteeship and fiduciary 
representatives services; providing advice, information and consultancy on the foregoing
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the U.S. application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found in or encompassed by those in the original U.S. 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e). Additionally, for U.S. 
applications filed under Trademark Act Section 44(e), the scope of the identification for purposes of 
permissible amendments may not exceed the scope of the goods and/or services identified in the 
foreign registration.  37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); Marmark, Ltd. v. Nutrexpa, S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845 
(TTAB 1989) (citing In re Löwenbräu München, 175 USPQ 178, 181 (TTAB 1972)); TMEP §§1012, 
1402.01(b).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Applicant must additionally respond to the requirement below.  
 
 
CLARIFICATION OF APPLICANT'S ENTITY TYPE REQUIRED  
 
Applicant included the designation “LLP” in its name; however, the legal entity is set forth as 
company. A limited liability partnership (LLP) is separate and distinct from a company. TMEP 
§803.03(i). Applicant must clarify the inconsistency between the designation in applicant’s name and 
the identified entity type. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(3)(iii), 2.61(b); TMEP §803.03(b), (k).
 
If applicant is a limited liability partnership, applicant must specify only the state or country where the 
LLP is organized; the names of the partners of a limited liability partnership are not required. TMEP 
§803.03(k).
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner ofthe mark, registration will be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
