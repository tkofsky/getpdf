Refusal Based on Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2) – Geographic Descriptiveness of the Mark 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is primarily geographically descriptive of the 
origin of applicant’s services. Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); see TMEP 
§§1210, 1210.01(a).
 
A mark is primarily geographically descriptive when the following is demonstrated:(1) The primary 
significance of the mark to the purchasing public is a generally known location; (2) The goods or 
services originate in the place identified in the mark; and
(3) The purchasing public would be likely to believe that the goods or services originate in the 
geographic place identified in the mark; that is, to make a goods-place or services-place 
association.  See Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *5 (TTAB 
2020) (citing In re Nantucket, Inc., 677 F.2d 95, 96-97, 213 USPQ 889, 891 (C.C.P.A. 1982)); see also 
In re Newbridge Cutlery Co., 776 F.3d 854, 860-61, 113 USPQ2d 1445, 1448-49 (Fed. Cir. 2015); In 
re Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1452 (Fed. 
Cir. 1987); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 (TTAB 2001)); TMEP §1210.01(a).
 
A goods-place or services-place association may be presumed where (1) the location in the mark is 
generally known to the purchasing public, (2) the term’s geographical significance is its primary 
significance, and (3) the goods and/or services do, in fact, originate from the named location in the 
mark. TMEP §1210.04; see, e.g., In re Cal. Pizza Kitchen Inc., 10 USPQ2d 1704, 1705 (TTAB 1988) 
(finding a services-place association was presumed between applicant’s restaurant services and 
California because the services originated in California); In re Handler Fenton Ws., Inc., 214 USPQ 
848, 850 (TTAB 1982) (finding a goods-place association was presumed between applicant’s t-shirts 
and Denver because the goods had their geographical origin in Denver); see also In re Nantucket, Inc., 
677 F.2d 95, 102, 213 USPQ 889, 895 (C.C.P.A. 1982) (Nies, J., concurring) (“[W]e must start with the 
concept that a geographic name of a place of business is a descriptive term when used on the goods of 
that business. There is a public goods/place association, in effect, presumed.” (internal footnote 
removed)).
 
The attached evidence demonstrates that Breckenridge is a known geographic location and describes 
the origin of the services: 
  
The attached dictionary entry shows that Breckenridge is a geographic location. 
•
 
The application indicates that the applicant is located in Breckenridge, Colorado.   
•
 
The applicant’s specimen shows that the applicant provides its services in Breckenridge, 
•Colorado.  
 
Purchasers who encounter the term "Breckenridge" with the identified services would immediately 
understand that the applicant’s services originate in Breckenridge; therefore the wording in the mark is 
geographically descriptive.   
 
The addition of generic or highly descriptive wording to a geographic term does not diminish that 
geographic term’s primary geographic significance. TMEP §1210.02(c)(ii); see, e.g., Spiritline Cruises 
LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *6-7 (TTAB 2020) (holding CHARLESTON 
HARBOR TOURS primarily geographically descriptive of various travel tour and cruise services 
because TOURS is generic for the services and CHARLESTON HARBOR is a well-known harbor in 
Charleston, South Carolina); In re Hollywood Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 1852, 1853-54 (TTAB 
2014) (holding HOLLYWOOD LAWYERS ONLINE primarily geographically descriptive of attorney 
referrals, online business information, and an online business directory). That is, the added term 
"Oktoberfest" does not diminish the geographic significance of the mark.  The attached dictionary entry 
shows that "Oktoberfest" indicates a type of festival such at that provided by the applicant.
 
For these reasons, the examining attorney finds that because the mark is geographically descriptive of 
the applicant's services, registration of the applicant's mark is refused under Trademark Act Section 
2(e)(2).
 
Although the applicant's mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Possible Response to Descriptiveness Refusal: Claim of Acquired Distinctiveness; Deletion of 
Disclaimer of Exclusive Rights to Use "BRECKENRIDGE"; Addition of Disclaimer of Exclusive 
Rights to Use "OKTOBERFEST" 
 
Claim of Acquired Distinctiveness
The application record indicates that applicant has used its mark for a long time; therefore, applicant 
has the option to amend the application to assert a claim of acquired distinctiveness under Trademark 
Act Section 2(f). See 15 U.S.C. §1052(f); TMEP §1212.05.
 
To amend the application to Section 2(f) based on five years’ use, applicant should request that the 
application be amended to assert a claim of acquired distinctiveness under Section 2(f) and submit the 
following written statement claiming acquired distinctiveness, if accurate:
 
The mark has become distinctive of the goods and/or services through the applicant’s 
substantially exclusive and continuous use of the mark in commerce that the U.S. Congress may 
lawfully regulate for at least the five years immediately before the date of this statement.
 
TMEP §1212.05(d); see 15 U.S.C. §1052(f); 37 C.F.R. §2.41(a)(2); TMEP §1212.08. This statement 
must be verified with an affidavit or signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20. 37 C.F.R. §2.41(a)(2); 
TMEP §1212.05(d); see 37 C.F.R. §2.193(e)(1).
 
Deletion of Disclaimer of Exclusive Rights to Use "BRECKENRIDGE"
With the claim of acquired distinctiveness, the disclaimer of the geographically descriptive term 
"BRECKENRIDGE" should be deleted.  Exclusive rights to use only generic wording within a claim of 
acquired distinctiveness should be disclaimed.  See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Am. Inst. of CertifiedPub. Accountants, 65 USPQ2d 1972, 1981-85 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a)   
 
Addition of Disclaimer of Exclusive Rights to Use "OKTOBERFEST"
With the claim of acquired distinctiveness, applicant must provide a disclaimer of exclusive right to use 
the generic word "Oktoberfest" apart from the mark as shown. See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Am. Inst. 
of Certified Pub. Accountants, 65 USPQ2d 1972, 1981-85 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). A 
disclaimer of an unregistrable part of a mark will not affect the mark’s appearance. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965).
 
In this case, applicant must disclaim the term “OKTOBERFEST” because it is not inherently 
distinctive. This term is a generic term for applicant’s services and is thus an unregistrable component 
of the mark. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); In re Am. Inst. of Certified Pub. Accountants, 65 USPQ2d at 
1981-85; TMEP §§1212.02(e), 1213.03(b).
 
A mark is generic if its primary significance to the relevant public is the class or category of goods or 
services with which it is used. See USPTO v. Booking.com B.V., 140 S. Ct. 2298, 2304, 2020 USPQ2d 
10729, at *5 (2020); Princeton Vanguard, LLC v. Frito-Lay N. Am., Inc., 786 F.3d 960, 965, 114 
USPQ2d 1827, 1830 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int’l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc., 
782 F.2d 987, 989-90, 228 USPQ 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); TMEP §1209.01(c)(i). Determining 
whether a mark is generic requires a two-step inquiry: (1) What is the genus of goods and/or services at 
issue?; (2) Does the relevant public understand the designation primarily to refer to that genus of goods 
and/or services? H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int’l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc., 782 F.2d at 989-90, 228 
USPQ at 530; In re Meridian Rack & Pinion, 114 USPQ2d 1462, 1463 (TTAB 2015); TMEP 
§1209.01(c)(i).
 
Regarding the first part of the inquiry, the genus of services is often defined by an applicant’s 
identification of goods or services. In re Meridian Rack & Pinion, 114 USPQ2d at 1463.  The 
application identifies the services as "entertainment in the nature of organizing and promoting cultural 
festivals wherein facilities for food, refreshments, dancing, concerts, souvenirs, contests, and other 
forms of amusement are provided," which adequately defines the genus at issue.  The attached 
dictionary entry indicates that "OKTOBERFEST" indicates these types of services -- "a fall festival 
usually featuring beer drinking."   
 
Regarding the second part of the inquiry, the relevant public is the purchasing or consuming public for 
the identified goods or services. Sheetz of Del., Inc. v. Doctor’s Assocs. Inc., 108 USPQ2d 1341, 1351 
(TTAB 2013). In this case, the relevant public comprises ordinary consumers because there are no 
limitations on the identification of services. The dictionary entry shows that the term 
“OKTOBERFEST” in the mark designates a fall festival, and thus the relevant public would understand 
this designation to refer primarily to the genus of services.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “OKTOBERFEST” apart from the mark as 
shown.

Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
