U.S. Pro se Applicant with a Post Office Box - Domicile Required & U.S.-licensed Attorney 
Advisory
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record identifies a 
post office box or mail forwarding service and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal place 
of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). A 
domicile address must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an 
individual applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal place 
of business, which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
Applications must include an applicant’s domicile address because such domicile determines whether 
an applicant is required to have a U.S.-licensed attorney represent it before the USPTO. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.11(a), 2.32(a)(2); TMEP §§601, 803.05. An applicant whose domicile is located outside of the 
United States or its territories must be represented at the USPTO by an attorney who is an active 
member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a U.S. state or territory. 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); 
TMEP §601.01(a).
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as an individual and specifies applicant’s domicile as 
a post office box instead of a street address. In most cases, a post office box is not acceptable as a 
domicile address because it does not identify the location of the place applicant resides and intends to 
be applicant’s principal home. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1).
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide documentation showing that the listed 
U.S. domicile address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that 
applicant has no fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §§601.01(b)-(b)(1), 803.05(a).
 
If applicant amends the application to list a domicile street address located outside of the United States 
or its territories, applicant must appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney under 37 C.F.R. §11.14 as its 
representative before the application may proceed to registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); TMEP 
§601.01(a). See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information. However, if applicant 
establishes its domicile street address is located within the United States or its territories, applicant is 
not required to appoint a qualified U.S.-licensed attorney. See TMEP §601.01(b).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark ElectronicApplication System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s domicile address. Applicant should provide 
documentation showing the name and listed domicile address of the individual, for example one of the 
following: (1) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement; (2) a current, valid 
homeowner’s, renter’s, or motor vehicle insurance policy; or (3) a computer-generated bill issued by a 
utility company dated no earlier than 60 days before the application filing date. TMEP §601.01(b)-
(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed domicile address, 
and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical place where applicant resides and intends to be its principal home, applicant should state for 
the record that applicant has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the 
circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.
 
To appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney in the application, applicant should submit a completed TEAS 
Change Address or Representation form. The newly-appointed attorney must submit a TEAS Response 
to Examining Attorney Office Action form indicating that an appointment of attorney has been made 
and address all other refusals or requirements in this action, if any. Alternatively, if applicant retains an 
attorney before filing the response, the attorney can respond to this Office action by using the 
appropriate TEAS response form and provide his or her attorney information in the form and sign it as 
applicant’s attorney. See 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b)(1)(ii); TMEP §604.01.
 
Name of Individual 
 
Applicant must clarify whether the name MALIBU CARL in the mark identifies a particular living 
individual. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§813, 1206.03. In this case, the application neither 
specifies whether the name in the mark identifies a particular living individual nor includes a written 
consent. See TMEP §§813.01(a)-(b), 1206.04(a), 1206.05.
 
To register a mark that consists of or comprises the name of a particular living individual, including a 
first name, pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, an applicant must provide a written consent 
personally signed by the named individual. 15 U.S.C. §1052(c); TMEP §§813, 1206.04(a).
 
Accordingly, if the name in the mark does not identify a particular living individual, applicantmust submit a statement to that effect (e.g., “The name shown in the mark does not identify a particular 
living individual.”).
 
However, if the name in the mark does identify a particular living individual, applicant must 
submit both of the following:
 
(1)        The following statement: “The name(s) shown in the mark identifies a 
living individual(s) whose consent(s) to register is made of record.” If the name is a 
pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, applicant must provide the following statement: 
“MALIBU CARL identifies _____________, a living individual whose consent is of 
record.”
 
(2)        A written consent, personally signed by the named individual(s), as follows: 
“I, ___________, consent to the use and registration of my name, MALIBU CARL, as a 
trademark and/or service mark with the USPTO.”
 
For an overview of the requirements for names appearing in marks, and instructions on how to satisfy 
this requirement using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see 
the Name/Portrait/Signature of Particular Living Individual in Mark webpage.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
Identification of Services - Clarification Required - Class 041
 
The wording “Entertainment services” in the identification of services is indefinite and must be 
clarified because it is ambiguous and unclear. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant 
must amend this wording to specify the common commercial or generic name of the services. See 
TMEP §1402.01. If the services have no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe 
or explain the nature of the services using clear and succinct language. See id.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:
 
"Entertainment services, namely, [insert type of services, e.g., wine tastings], in International Class 
041."
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).Disclaimer
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “MALIBU” because it is primarily geographically descriptive of 
the origin of applicant’s services. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); In re Societe Generale des Eaux 
Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1451-52 (Fed. Cir. 1987); TMEP 
§§1210.01(a), 1210.06(a), 1213.03(a).
 
The attached evidence from Oxford Dictionary shows that "Malibu" is a generally known geographic 
place or location. See TMEP §§1210.02 et seq. The services for which applicant seeks registration 
originate in this geographic place or location as shown by the applicant's address. See TMEP §1210.03. 
Because the services originate in this place or location, a public association of the services with the 
place is presumed. See In re Hollywood Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 1852, 1858 (TTAB 2014) 
(citing In re Spirits of New Merced, LLC, 85 USPQ2d 1614, 1621 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §§1210.02(a) 
1210.04.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “MALIBU” apart from the mark as shown.
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
