Mark:  TAC HOLSTER

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Section 2(d) Refusal - Likelihood of Confusion
•
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive
•
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL - LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 4260658 and 3829096. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Applicant's mark is TAC HOLSTER in standard character form for "Ammunition; Explosives; 
Firearms; Fireworks; Ammunition bags; Ammunition for firearms; Holsters; Projectiles; Combination 
holster and ammunition magazine pouch; Pistol holsters" in Class 13.      
 
Registrants' marks are:
 
TAC (Registration No. 4260658) in standard character form for "Gun powder" in Class 13.
 
TAC (Registration No. 3829096) in standard character form for "Firearms" in Class 13. 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence ofrecord related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
COMPARISON OF THE MARKS 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
 
RELATEDNESS OF THE GOODS
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).  
 
Relatedness to Registration No. 4260658
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of third-party enterprises offering gunpowder and 
ammunition, establishes that the relevant goods are sold or provided through the same trade channels 
and used by the same classes of consumers in the same fields of use.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s 
goods are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty 
Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 
1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).

https://www.defenderammunition.com/Relatedness to Registration No. 3829096 
 
Both the application and registration recite "firearms" and thus are partially identical with respect to 
these goods.  Additionally, the attached Internet evidence, consisting of third-party enterprises offering 
firearms and ammunition, establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures the relevant goods 
and markets the goods under the same mark and the relevant goods are sold or provided through the 
same trade channels and used by the same classes of consumers in the same fields of use.  Thus, 
applicant’s and registrant’s goods are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, 
e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. 
Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).

Thus, upon encountering applicant’s mark TAC HOLSTER in commerce, consumers are likely to be 
confused as to the source of applicant’s and the cited registrants' goods.  Therefore, with the 
contemporaneous use of highly similar marks, consumers are likely to conclude that the goods are 
related and originate from the same source.  As such, registration on the Principal Register must be 
refused under Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.
 
Applicant should note the following additional ground for refusal.
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a characteristic of applicant’s 
goods. Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et 
seq.
 
Applicant's mark is TAC HOLSTER in standard character form for "Ammunition; Explosives; 
Firearms; Fireworks; Ammunition bags; Ammunition for firearms; Holsters; Projectiles; Combination 
holster and ammunition magazine pouch; Pistol holsters" in Class 13. 
 
An abbreviation, initialism, or acronym is merely descriptive when it is generally understood as 
“substantially synonymous” with the descriptive words it represents. See In re Thomas Nelson, Inc., 97 
USPQ2d 1712, 1715 (TTAB 2011) (citing Modern Optics, Inc. v. Univis Lens Co., 234 F.2d 504, 506, 
110 USPQ 293, 295 (C.C.P.A. 1956)) (holding NKJV substantially synonymous with merely 
descriptive term “New King James Version” and thus merely descriptive of bibles); In re BetaBatt Inc., 
89 USPQ2d 1152, 1155 (TTAB 2008) (holding DEC substantially synonymous with merely descriptive 
term “direct energy conversion” and thus merely descriptive of a type of batteries and battery related 
services); TMEP §1209.03(h).A mark consisting of an abbreviation, initialism, or acronym will be considered substantially 
synonymous with descriptive wording if:
 
(1)     the applied-for mark is an abbreviation, initialism, or acronym for specific wording;
 
(2)     the specific wording is merely descriptive of applicant’s goods and/or services; and
 
(3) a relevant consumer viewing the abbreviation, initialism, or acronym in connection with 
applicant’s goods and/or services will recognize it as the equivalent of the merely descriptive 
wording it represents.
 
TMEP §1209.03(h); see In re Thomas Nelson, Inc., 97 USPQ2d at 1715-16 (citing In re Harco Corp., 
220 USPQ 1075, 1076 (TTAB 1984)).
 
In the present case, the attached evidence from abbreviationfinder.org shows that the term "TAC" in 
applicant’s mark is an abbreviation for the wording “tactical.” Further, the attached evidence from 
ahdictionary.com shows that this wording is merely descriptive of a characteristic of applicant’s 
firearms, holsters, and ammunition because "tactical" means "relating to, using, or involving tactics," 
and "tactics" means "military actions or maneuvers used against an enemy."  This term describes a 
characteristic of the goods by allowing a user to employ the goods for action or maneuvers against a 
threat or enemy.  The term "HOLSTER" is also defined to mean "a case of leather or similar material 
into which a pistol fits snugly and which attaches to a belt, strap, or saddle so that it may be carried or 
transported."  This term describes a function of the recited goods, which includes "holsters."
 
Lastly, a relevant consumer viewing "TAC" in applicant’s mark in connection with the identified 
goods would recognize it as the equivalent of the descriptive wording it represents because third-party 
webpage evidence showing holsters display "TAC" frequently in connection with descriptions of the 
goods being "tactical," and because "TAC" contains the first three words of "tactical" consumers would 
recognize the term as being equivalent to "tactical" and descriptive of a characteritic, purpose, or use of 
the goods.  Furthermore, the composite "TAC HOLSTER" is descriptive of applicant's holsters, which 
are for military action or use or use against threats or enemies.
 
For these reasons, the marks is merely descriptive in relation to the applied-for goods and therefore 
registration on the Principal Register is refused under Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act.

“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
