NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 22, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
 
Specimen RefusedSpecimen is merely a drawing or depiction of the mark. Registration is refused because the 
specimen is merely a photocopy of the drawing or a depiction of the applied-for mark and does not 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the goods and/or services in International 
Class(es) 035. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 
2.56(a), (c); In re Chica, 84 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (TTAB 2007); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 
1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing 
the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods and/or services 
identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include: 
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following 
statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: 
“The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
the amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this 
statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimenwebpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120886
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
