•
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that so resembles a registered mark 
that it is likely a potential consumer would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the source of the 
services of the applicant and registrant.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  A determination of likelihood of 
confusion under Section 2(d) is made on a case-by-case basis and the factors set forth in In re E. I. du 
Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) aid in this 
determination.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d 1344, 1349, 98 USPQ2d 1253, 
1256 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citing On-Line Careline, Inc. v. Am. Online, Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1085, 56 
USPQ2d 1471, 1474 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).  Not all the du Pont factors, however, are necessarily relevant or 
of equal weight, and any one of the factors may control in a given case, depending upon the evidence of 
record.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d at 1355, 98 USPQ2d at 1260; In re 
Majestic Distilling Co., 315 F.3d 1311, 1315, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see In re E. I. 
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d at 1361-62, 177 USPQ at 567.
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant:  similarity of the marks, similarity and nature 
of the services, and similarity of the trade channels of the services.  See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Dakin’s Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d1593, 1595-96 (TTAB 1999); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
COMPARISON OF THE MARKS
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Applicant's mark is REFRAME LIFESTAGE.
 
The registered marks are REFRAME and LIFESTAGES.
 
REFRAME 
 
In this case, both marks feature the wording "REFRAME".  Marks may be confusingly similar in 
appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the compared 
marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial 
Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 
(Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly similar); In re Corning 
Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly 
similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 1983) (holding MILTRON and 
MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
As the first or only term in each mark, the common wording "REFRAME" is the dominant portion of 
each mark. Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any 
trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 
1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between 
VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a 
‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 
Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) 
(finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because 
“consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial 
words is particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”).
 
Applicant's addition of a term to the registered mark will not avoid a likelihood of confusion 
here.  Adding a term to a registered mark generally does not obviate the similarity between the 
compared marks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 
2(d). See Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 
106 (C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL and BENGAL LANCER and design confusingly similar); In 
re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1269 (TTAB 2009) (holding TITAN and VANTAGE 
TITAN confusingly similar); In re El Torito Rests., Inc., 9 USPQ2d 2002, 2004 (TTAB 1988) (holding 
MACHO and MACHO COMBOS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii). In the present case,the marks are identical in part.  
 
Furthermore, generally, the greater the degree of similarity between the applied-for mark and the 
registered mark, the lesser the degree of similarity between the services of the parties is required to 
support a finding of likelihood of confusion. In re C.H. Hanson Co., 116 USPQ2d 1351, 1353 (TTAB 
2015) (citing In re Opus One Inc., 60 USPQ2d 1812, 1815 (TTAB 2001)); In re House Beer, LLC, 114 
USPQ2d 1073, 1077 (TTAB 2015) (citing In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1206, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 
1688 (Fed. Cir. 1993); Time Warner Ent. Co. v. Jones, 65 USPQ2d 1650, 1661 (TTAB 2002); In re 
Opus One Inc., 60 USPQ2d at 1815); TMEP §1207.01(a).
 
LIFESTAGES 
 
In this case, both marks feature the wording "LIFESTAGE".  Marks may be confusingly similar in 
appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the compared 
marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial 
Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 
(Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly similar); In re Corning 
Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly 
similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 1983) (holding MILTRON and 
MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
Applicant's addition of a term to the registered mark will not avoid a likelihood of confusion 
here.  Adding a term to a registered mark generally does not obviate the similarity between the 
compared marks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 
2(d). See Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 
106 (C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL and BENGAL LANCER and design confusingly similar); In 
re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1269 (TTAB 2009) (holding TITAN and VANTAGE 
TITAN confusingly similar); In re El Torito Rests., Inc., 9 USPQ2d 2002, 2004 (TTAB 1988) (holding 
MACHO and MACHO COMBOS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii). In the present case, 
the marks are identical in part.
 
Furthermore, where the services of an applicant and registrant are “similar in kind and/or closely 
related,” the degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding of likelihood of 
confusion is not as great as in the case of diverse services.  In re J.M. Originals Inc., 6 USPQ2d 1393, 
1394 (TTAB 1987); see Shen Mfg. Co. v. Ritz Hotel Ltd., 393 F.3d 1238, 1242, 73 USPQ2d 1350, 1354 
(Fed. Cir. 2004); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
COMPARISON OF THE SERVICES
 
The services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).  The compared services 
need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. 
Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 
214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only 
be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding their marketing are such that they 
could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs.,Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of entities that provide insurance underwriting services for 
life and long term care insurance, as well as fraud insurance and prevention services and/or risk 
management and consulting services, all under the same mark, establishes that the same entity 
commonly provides the relevant services and markets the services under the same mark (See attached 
evidence from Allstate®, Liberty Mutual®, Geico®, Travelers®, fticonsulting.com, and 
securian.com).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are considered related for likelihood of 
confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); 
In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the services, but to 
protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer.  
See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  Therefore, any 
doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the registrant.  TMEP 
§1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1265, 62 USPQ2d 
1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 
1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
In light of the similarities between the marks and the relatedness of the services, it is likely that 
consumers who encounter the parties' services will falsely conclude that they originate from the same 
source.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
 
PRIOR-FILED PENDING APPLICATION 
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 88912321 (LIFE STAGES INSURANCE & 
FINANCIAL SERVICES FREEDOM FOR YOUR PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS) precedes applicant’s 
filing date.  See attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, 
applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood 
of confusion between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  
Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be 
suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action.  
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action.  See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.  The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails 
can be used for informal communications and are included in the application record.  See 37 C.F.R.§§2.62(c), 2.191; TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

Ann K. FordUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120627
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
