SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 4339195 and 6717603.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registrations. 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”).  In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.”  In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis:  (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services.  See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.  
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or 
services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer.  See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
 Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the 
registrant.  TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).The applicant’s mark is TAO (stylzed) for bags including purses, business card holders, shopping bags, 
key cases, tote bags, shoulder bags, backpacks, and school bags in class 18 and various clothing in class 
25. 
 
The registrants' marks are:
 
    1.  TAO (Reg. No. 4339195, owner Tao Technical-Wear GMBH) for "functionally adapted clothing 
and apparel specially developed for application in running, triathlon and other ambitious stamina 
sports, namely, shirts, t-shirts, polo shirts, tops, tank tops, [ jumpers, ] sweaters, [ pullovers, ] tights, 
jackets, wind resistant jackets, pants, shorts, knickers, underwear, caps, belts, socks, gloves, waistcoats, 
running tops;"
 
        2.  TAO LI SHU (Reg. No. 6717603, owner Guangzhou Bogemeng Trading Co) for "luggage; 
purses; valises; attaché cases; business card cases; canvas shopping bags; key cases; leather bags; 
leather credit card wallets; military duffle bags, garment bags for travel, tote bags, shoulder bags and 
backpacks; pocket wallets; school bags; travelling bags." 
 
The marks are similar in this case.  First, a mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in 
any lettering style; the rights reside in the wording or other literal element and not in any particular 
display or rendition. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 
2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.52(a); TMEP §1207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a mark presented in stylized characters and/or with a design 
element generally will not avoid likelihood of confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters 
because the word portion could be presented in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 
671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 
939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that “the argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable 
where one party asserts rights in no particular display”).
 
With respect to TAO, the marks are identical.  Where the marks of the respective parties are identical or 
virtually identical, as in this case, the degree of similarity or relatedness between the goods needed to 
support a finding of likelihood of confusion declines. See In re Country Oven, Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 
443903, at *5 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), 
aff’d, 866 F.3d 1315, 123 USPQ2d 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2017)); TMEP §1207.01(a); see also In re Shell Oil 
Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1207, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 1993).
 
With respect to the TAO LI SHU, the marks contain the identical term TAO.  Marks may be 
confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases 
appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l 
Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 
USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly 
similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and 
CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
In addition, although applicant’s mark does not contain the entirety of the registered mark, applicant’s 
mark is likely to appear to prospective purchasers as a shortened form of registrant’s mark. See In re 
Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting United StatesShoe Corp., 229 USPQ 707, 709 (TTAB 1985)). Thus, merely omitting some of the wording from a 
registered mark may not overcome a likelihood of confusion. See In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 
1342, 94 USPQ2d 1257; In re Optica Int’l, 196 USPQ 775, 778 (TTAB 1977); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-
(iii). In this case, applicant’s mark does not create a distinct commercial impression from the registered 
mark because it contains the identical term TAO as in the registered mark and does not add any 
wording that would distinguish it from that mark.  Consumers are likely to be confused as to the source 
of the goods when they encounter the goods bearing the marks because they are likely to believe that 
the goods emanate from the same source. The marks are highly similar.
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The goods are identical and related in this case.  The applicant and the registrant of TAO LI SHU both 
provide the same types of bags such as purses, business card holders, shopping bags, key cases, tote 
bags, shoulder bags, backpacks, and school bags.  Where the goods of an applicant and registrant are 
identical or virtually identical, the degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding 
that confusion is likely declines. See Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 
1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 
(Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Please note the Office does not need to find similarity as to each good listed in the applicant’s and 
registrant’s identifications.  It is sufficient for a refusal based on likelihood of confusion that the Office 
find any goods that comes within the identification of goods in a particular class in the application 
related to any of the goods within the cited registration.  Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., 
648 F.2d 1335, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (CCPA 1981); In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 USPQ2d 1406, 1409 
(TTAB 2015), aff’d 866 F.3d 1315, 123 USPQ2d 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2017); In re Aquamar, Inc., 115 
USPQ2d 1122, 1126 n.5 (TTAB 2015) (“[I]t is sufficient for finding a likelihood of confusion if 
relatedness is established for any item encompassed by the identification of goods within a particular 
class in the application.”).
 
In addition, the applicant and the registrant of TAO both provide the same types of clothing.  Although 
the registrant's goods are "functionally adapted clothing and apparel specially adapted for application in 
running, triathlon and other ambitious stamina sports," there is no limitation in the applicant's goods 
and therefore the goods may also be used for the same purposes.  Decisions regarding likelihood of 
confusion in the clothing field have found many different types of apparel to be related. Cambridge 
Rubber Co. v. Cluett, Peabody & Co., 286 F.2d 623, 624, 128 USPQ 549, 550 (C.C.P.A. 1961) 
(women’s boots related to men’s and boys’ underwear); Gen. Shoe Corp. v. Hollywood-Maxwell Co., 
277 F.2d 169, 169-70, 125 USPQ2d 443, 443-4 (C.C.P.A. 1960) (shoes and hosiery related tobrassieres); In re Embiid, 2021 USPQ2d 577, at *29-30 (TTAB 2021) (shoes related to shirts and sweat 
shirts); Jockey Int’l, Inc. v. Mallory & Church Corp., 25 USPQ2d 1233, 1236 (TTAB 1992) 
(underwear related to neckties); In re Melville Corp., 18 USPQ2d 1386, 1388 (TTAB 1991) (women’s 
pants, blouses, shorts and jackets related to women’s shoes); In re Pix of Am., Inc., 225 USPQ 691, 
691-92 (TTAB 1985) (women’s shoes related to outer shirts); In re Mercedes Slacks, Ltd., 213 USPQ 
397, 398-99 (TTAB 1982) (hosiery related to trousers); In re Cook United, Inc., 185 USPQ 444, 445 
(TTAB 1975) (men’s suits, coats, and trousers related to ladies’ pantyhose and hosiery); Esquire 
Sportswear Mfg. Co. v. Genesco Inc., 141 USPQ 400, 404 (TTAB 1964) (brassieres and girdles related 
to slacks for men and young men).  The application does not contain any limitations regarding trade 
channels for the goods, and therefore it is assumed that registrant’s and applicant’s goods are sold 
everywhere that is normal for such items, i.e., clothing and department stores. Thus, it can also be 
assumed that the same classes of purchasers shop for these items and that consumers are accustomed to 
seeing them sold under the same or similar marks. See Kangol Ltd. v. KangaROOS U.S.A., Inc., 974 
F.2d 161, 23 USPQ2d 1945 (Fed. Cir. 1992); In re Smith & Mehaffey, 31 USPQ2d 1531 (TTAB 1994); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(iii).   
 
Please also see the attached excerpted representative articles, establishing that specific-use clothing 
such as triathlon clothing and casual clothing are sold or provided through the same trade channels and 
used by the same classes of consumers in the same fields of use.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s 
goods are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty 
Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 
1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
The goods travel in the same channels of trade.  Or, the conditions surrounding their marketing may be 
such, that they could be encountered by the same purchasers under circumstances that could give rise to 
the mistaken belief that the goods come from a common source.
 
The similarities among the mark and the goods of the parties are so great as to create a likelihood of 
confusion.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
INFORMALITIES
 
If applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below. 
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS 
 
Some of the identification of goods are indefinite and must be clarified.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.01.  Applicant must amend the identification to specify the common commercial or 
generic name of the goods.  See TMEP §1402.01.  If the goods have no common commercial or generic 
name, applicant must describe the product, its main purpose, and its intended uses.  See id.
 
The identification of goods contains parentheses. Generally, an applicant should not use parentheses 
and brackets, including curly brackets, in identifications in order to avoid confusion with the USPTO’s 
practice of using parentheses and brackets in registrations to indicate (1) goods and/or services that 
have been deleted from registrations, (2) goods and/or services not claimed in an affidavit ofincontestability, or (3) guidance to users of the USPTO’s U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and 
Services Manual to draft an acceptable identification. See TMEP §§1402.04, 1402.12. The only 
exception for including parenthetical information in identifications is if it serves to explain or translate 
the matter immediately preceding the parenthetical phrase in such a way that it does not affect the 
clarity or scope of the identification, e.g., “fried tofu pieces (abura-age).” See TMEP §1402.12.
 
Therefore, applicant must remove the parentheses from the identification and incorporate any 
parenthetical or bracketed information into the description of the goods.
 
In addition, the wording “including” in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be deleted. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03(a). The identification must be specific and all-
inclusive. This wording is an open-ended term (e.g.,  “such as”) that is not acceptable because it fails to 
identify specific goods. See TMEP §1402.03(a).
 
For easier reference, the suggested amendments are shown in bold and italics.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Folding briefcases, shoulder bags, Gladstone bags, briefcases, suitcases, carry-on bags, tote 
bags, trunks being luggage, handbags, Boston bags, schoolchildren's backpacks, backpacks in the 
nature of rucksacks, credit card cases, textile shopping bags, wheeled shopping bags, purses not of 
precious metal, key cases, wallets not of precious metal, commuter's-pass holders in the nature of 
mass transit card cases, business card cases, vanity cases, not fitted, umbrellas and their parts, 
parasols, industrial packaging containers of leather, clothing for domestic pets, walking sticks, canes, in 
international class 18;
 
Clothing, one-piece dresses, jackets, clothing of leather, namely, (SPECIFY type of clothing, e.g., 
leather jackets, leather pants, etc.), suits, vests, coats, sweatshirts, trousers and pants, shirts, polo 
shirts, blouses, dresses, skirts, t-shirts, nightwear, underwear, evening gowns, sweaters, cardigans, 
overalls, garters, belts for clothing, waistbands, suspenders, neckties, scarves, hosiery, shoes, athletic 
shoes, overshoes, headgear for wear, namely, hats and caps being headwear, gloves, swimwear, 
boots, masquerade costumes, in international class 25.
 
Please note the parentheticals denote place(s) where the applicant must provide acceptable 
identifications.  Any identification must be incorporated into the identification without the use of 
parentheticals or brackets. 
sho
Applicant’s goods may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those originally 
itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. 
Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting items to 
result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods or add 
goods not found or encompassed by those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 
TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification 
and is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP 
§§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any acceptable changes to the goods will further limit scope, and once 
goods are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, 
please see the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and ServicesManual. See TMEP §1402.04.  To expedite prosecution of this trademark application, when 
amending the identification as required above, the Office strongly encourages the applicant to 
select pre-approved wording contained within this manual that accurately describes the goods 
and/or services therein.  Failure to do so may result in delay.
 
BASIS
 
The application specifies both an intent to use basis under Trademark Act Section 1(b) and a claim of 
priority under Section 44(d) based on a foreign application. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 1126(d); 37 
C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2), (a)(4). However, no copy of a foreign registration has been provided even though 
the application indicates applicant’s intent to rely on Section 44(e) as an additional basis for 
registration. See 15 U.S.C. §1126(e).
 
An application with a Section 44(e) basis must include a true copy, photocopy, certification, or certified 
copy of a foreign registration from an applicant’s country of origin. 15 U.S.C. §1126(e); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §§1004, 1004.01, 1016. In addition, an applicant’s country of origin must be a 
party to a convention or treaty relating to trademarks to which the United States is also a party, or must 
extend reciprocal registration rights to nationals of the United States by law. 15 U.S.C. §1126(b); 
TMEP §§1002.01, 1004.
 
Therefore, applicant must provide a copy of the foreign registration from applicant’s country of origin 
when it becomes available. TMEP §1003.04(a). A copy of a foreign registration must consist of a 
document issued to an applicant by, or certified by, the intellectual property office in applicant’s 
country of origin. TMEP §1004.01. If applicant’s country of origin does not issue registrations or 
Madrid Protocol certificates of extension of protection, applicant may submit a copy of the Madrid 
Protocol international registration that shows that protection of the international registration has been 
extended to applicant’s country of origin. TMEP §1016. In addition, applicant must also provide an 
English translation if the foreign registration is not written in English. 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP 
§1004.01(a)-(b). The translation should be signed by the translator. TMEP §1004.01(b).
 
If the foreign registration has not yet issued, or applicant requires additional time to procure a copy of 
the foreign registration (and English translation, as appropriate), applicant should so inform the 
trademark examining attorney and request that the U.S. application be suspended until a copy of the 
foreign registration is available. TMEP §§716.02(b), 1003.04(b).
 
If applicant cannot satisfy the requirements of a Section 44(e) basis, applicant may request that the 
mark be approved for publication based solely on the Section 1(b) basis. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 
1126(e); 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §§806.02(f), 806.04(b), 1003.04(b). Although the mark may be 
approved for publication on the Section 1(b) basis, it will not register until an acceptable allegation of 
use has been filed. See 15 U.S.C. §1051(c)-(d); 37 C.F.R. §§2.76, 2.88; TMEP §1103. Please note that, 
if the U.S. application satisfied the requirements of Section 44(d) as of the U.S. application filing date, 
applicant may retain the priority filing date under Section 44(d) without perfecting the Section 44(e) 
basis, provided there is a continuing valid basis for registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(3)-(4); TMEP 
§§806.02(f), 806.04(b).
 
Alternatively, applicant has the option to amend the application to rely solely on the Section 44(e) basis 
and request deletion of the Section 1(b) basis. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §806.04. The foreign 
registration alone may serve as the basis for obtaining a U.S. registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3);

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120307
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
