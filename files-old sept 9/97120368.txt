Search Results
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.  However, registration is refused for the following reason.

Requirement for Acceptable Identification and Classification of Goods (and Compliance with 
Multiple-Class Application Requirements, if applicable)
•
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal – Merely Descriptive
 
The applicant has applied for registration of the mark WILDFLOWER APOTHECARY in standard 
character form for:
 
International Class 003: Skin care products 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes characteristics of applicant’s 
goods.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et 
seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
“Whether consumers could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone 
is not the test.” In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985). The question is not 
whether someone presented only with the mark could guess what the goods and/or services are, but 
“whether someone who knows what the goods and[/or] services are will understand the mark toconvey information about them.” DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting In re Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 
1314, 1316-17 (TTAB 2002)); In re Mueller Sports. Med., Inc., 126 USPQ2d 1584, 1587 (TTAB 
2018).
 
In this case, both the individual components and composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
goods and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods.  
Specifically, the words “wildflower” and “apothecary” are defined as follows: 
 
wildflower: the flower of a wild or uncultivated plant or the plant bearing it. Merriam-Webster’s 
Dictionary (2022), https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wildflower, Atch 1.
 
apothecary: one who prepares and sells drugs or compounds for medicinal purposes. Merriam-
Webster’s Dictionary (2022), https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apothecary, Atch 2. 
 
Notably, the above definition of apothecary is broader than the pharmacy definition also included in 
this dictionary, in that the compounds could include substances other than drugs, like the skin care 
preparations included in this application.  Further, this term is often used to refer to compounds that 
have broader wellness effects than prescription pharmaceuticals.
 
Thus, purchasers who encounter WILDFLOWER APOTHECARY on the identified goods would 
immediately understand that applicant’s goods are compounds that incorporate wildflowers for 
wellness and medicinal purposes.  The applicant's specimen of record confirms that the goods do 
include wildflowers as ingredients and have been developed to address specific purposes.  For example, 
the cleanser is "infused with herbs/flowers, in specific combination, to . . . naturally balance the skins 
Ph," and the moisturizer "took . . . 3 years to perfect," and includes "11 specific wildflowers/herbs," 
resulting in "some serious plant medicine."
 
The attached additional printouts from the applicant's website, Atchs 3a-b, confirm that the goods are 
made from wildflowers for specific medicinal purposes, and even uses the term "apothecary" in 
reference to the applicant's stock of plants.
 
Material obtained from applicant’s website is acceptable as competent evidence. See In re N.V. 
Organon, 79 USPQ2d 1639, 1642-43 (TTAB 2006); In re Promo Ink, 78 USPQ2d 1301, 1302-03 
(TTAB 2006); TBMP §1208.03; TMEP §710.01(b).
 
The applicant is also referred to the attached representative sample of 10 third-party registrations for 
marks that include the term APOTHECARY for similar goods in Class 3. Atchs 4a-i. Each of these 
marks is registered either on the Supplemental Register, or with a disclaimer of APOTHECARY.
 
Third-party registrations featuring goods and/or services the same as or similar to applicant’s goods 
and/or services are probative evidence on the issue of descriptiveness where the relevant word or term 
is disclaimed or registered on the Supplemental Register. E.g., In re Morinaga Nyugyo Kabushiki 
Kaisha, 120 USPQ2d 1738, 1745 (TTAB 2016) (quoting Inst. Nat’l des Appellations D’Origine v. 
Vintners Int’l Co., 958 F.2d 1574, 1581-82, 22 USPQ2d 1190, 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1992)); In re Box 
Solutions Corp., 79 USPQ2d 1953, 1955 (TTAB 2006).
 
All of this evidence demonstrates that the mark WILDFLOWER APOTHECARY as applied to the 
identified goods merely describes characteristics of the applicant's goods.  Accordingly, the proposedmark is merely descriptive, and registration is refused on the Principal Register under Section 2(e)(1). 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  Please note that informal 
communications (phone and email) may not be used to request advisory opinions as to the 
likelihood of overcoming a substantive refusal.  TMEP §709.05.  To properly introduce Internet 
evidence into the record, an applicant must provide (1) an image file or printout of the downloaded 
webpage, (2) the date the evidence was downloaded or accessed, and (3) the complete URL address of 
the webpage. See In re I-Coat Co., LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018); TBMP §1208.03; 
TMEP §710.01(b).  
 
Section 2(f) or Amendment to Supplemental Register Recommended 
 
The application record indicates that applicant has used its mark for a long time; therefore, applicant 
has the option to amend the application to assert a claim of acquired distinctiveness under Trademark 
Act Section 2(f). See 15 U.S.C. §1052(f); TMEP §1212.05.
 
To amend the application to Section 2(f) based on five years’ use, applicant should request that the 
application be amended to assert a claim of acquired distinctiveness under Section 2(f) and submit the 
following written statement claiming acquired distinctiveness, if accurate:
 
The mark has become distinctive of the goods and/or services through the applicant’s 
substantially exclusive and continuous use of the mark in commerce that the U.S. Congress 
may lawfully regulate for at least the five years immediately before the date of this 
statement.
 
TMEP §1212.05(d); see 15 U.S.C. §1052(f); 37 C.F.R. §2.41(a)(2); TMEP §1212.08. This statement 
must be verified with an affidavit or signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20. 37 C.F.R. §2.41(a)(2); 
TMEP §1212.05(d); see 37 C.F.R. §2.193(e)(1).
 
In the alternative, applicant may respond to the refusal by amending the application to seek registration 
on the Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 
816. Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant from submitting evidence and 
arguments against the refusal(s). TMEP §816.04.
 
Although registration on the Supplemental Register does not afford all the benefits of registration on 
the Principal Register, it does provide the following advantages to the registrant:
 
(1)       Use of the registration symbol ® with the registered mark in connection with 
the designated goods and/or services, which provides public notice of the registration and 
potentially deters third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(2)       Inclusion of the registered mark in the USPTO’s database of registered and 
pending marks, which will (a) make it easier for third parties to find it in trademark search 
reports, (b) provide public notice of the registration, and thus (c) potentially deter third 
parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(3)       Use of the registration by a USPTO trademark examining attorney as a bar to 
registering confusingly similar marks in applications filed by third parties.(4)       Use of the registration as a basis to bring suit for trademark infringement in 
federal court, which, although more costly than state court, means judges with more 
trademark experience, often faster adjudications, and the opportunity to seek an injunction, 
actual damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
(5)       Use of the registration as a filing basis for a trademark application for 
registration in certain foreign countries, in accordance with international treaties.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(d), 1091, 1094; J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair 
Competition §§19:33, 19:37 (rev. 4th ed. Supp. 2017).
 
If applicant responds to the refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
Requirement for Acceptable Identification and Classification of Goods
 
Applicant’s goods are identified as:
 
International Class 003: Skin care products 
 
The wording “Skin care products” in the identification of goods must be clarified because it is too 
broad and could include goods in other international classes. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.03. In particular, this wording could encompass non-medicated skin care preparations 
in Class 3, and medicated preparations in Class 5.  Additionally, the term "products" is broad enough to 
include goods in other classes.  For example, this wording could include hand and power operated 
brushes for cleaning and exfoliating the skin, and applicators sold empty for applying cosmetic skin 
care lotions, which are classified in Class 21.
 
To summarize, applicant may adopt any or all of the following identifications of goods, if accurate: 
 
International Class 003: non-medicated Skin care preparations 
 
International Class 005: medicated Skin care preparations 
 
International Class 021: Skin care products, namely, hand and power operated brushes for 
cleaning and exfoliating the skin, and applicators sold empty for applying cosmetic skin care 
lotions 
 
See TMEP §1402.01.
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).Classification of goods and services is a purely administrative matter within the sole discretion of the 
USPTO. See In re Faucher Indus. Inc., 107 USPQ2d 1355, 1357 (TTAB 2013) (quoting In re Tee-Pak, 
Inc., 164 USPQ 88, 89 (TTAB 1969)).
 
Multiple-Class Application Requirements 
 
The application references goods based on use in commerce in more than one international class; 
therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the 
fee already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods based on use in commerce that are classified in at least three classes; 
however, applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only one class. Applicant must either (a) 
submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) restrict the 
application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for classes 3 and 5; but applicant needs a specimen for class 21. See more 
information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
 Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the 
webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within 
the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 
or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 
1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce 
on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as 
early as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(a) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see theMultiple-class Application webpage.
 
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120368
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.

APOTHECARY (Docket No. 38801.1) - please respond by 12:00 ET, tomorrow
 
Mr. Cook,
 
I’ve been assigned to review these trademark applications.  Before I can approve the marks for 
publication, there are some issues that must be addressed.
 
Specifically, the marks appear to be merely descriptive of these goods and services.  However, 
because the marks have been in use for over 5 years, I would be willing to accept a Section 2(f) 
claim, instead of issuing refusals.  Because the claim would need to be supported by a signed 
declaration, I cannot enter it by Examiner’s Amendment. Instead, you would need to submit it using 
our voluntary amendment, accessible on this webpage: 
https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/apply/miscellaneous-forms.  To include the statement and the 
declaration, you would need to change the answers to Yes for Questions 2 and 8.  If for some reason 
you don’t think a Section 2(f) claim would be appropriate in this case, I could amend them to the 
Supplemental Register by Examiner’s Amendment, if you provide your consent by reply email.
Serial Number: 97120368  
Date: 08/25/2022 11:05 am  
Created by: Kim MoninghoffThis is the only issue for two of the applications.  For the application filed for Class 3, the goods also 
need to be amended to limit them to that class, such as the following:
 
International Class 003: non-medicated Skin care preparations
 
This amendment could be included in the voluntary amendment, or I can enter it by Examiner’s 
Amendment with your consent (provided by reply email).
 
I plan to be out of the office Friday of this week and all of next week, so for the voluntary amendments 
to be updated in time for me to accept them this week, they would need to be filed by noon eastern 
tomorrow.  Please let me know if you submit them so I can make sure they are updated in our 
system.
 
If you have any questions, please let me know.
 
If I don’t hear back from you by noon tomorrow, and the amendments discussed above have not been 
entered, I will send you formal Office actions for these issues.  As a reminder, I cannot accept 
argument/evidence by email (or phone) so you would need to wait until I issue the refusals to submit 
any argument/evidence in a formal response.  Also, I understand that this does not give you much 
time to consult with the applicant, but you would still be able to submit the Section 2(f) in formal 
responses, any time during the 6-month response period.  Thank you.
