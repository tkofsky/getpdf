Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.

Mark is merely descriptive/possibly generic
•
Specimen
•
Color/Description of mark
•
 
SEARCH RESULT
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL--MARK IS MERELY DESCRIPTIVE 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes the applicant’s goods.  
Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services.  TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson 
LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 
1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of 
Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)). 
 
The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s goods 
and/or services, not in the abstract.  DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 
675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b).  “Whether 
consumers could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the 
test.”  In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).  Determining the descriptiveness 
of a mark is done in relation to an applicant’s goods and/or services, the context in which the mark is 
being used, and the possible significance the mark would have to the average purchaser because of the 
manner of its use or intended use.  See In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 
1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing In re Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d 960, 
963-64, 82 USPQ2d 1828, 1831 (Fed. Cir. 2007)); TMEP §1209.01(b).  Descriptiveness of a mark is 
not considered in the abstract.  In re Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d at 963-64, 82 USPQ2d at 1831.“A mark may be merely descriptive even if it does not describe the ‘full scope and extent’ of the 
applicant’s goods or services.”  In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 
1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (citing In re Dial-A-Mattress Operating Corp., 240 F.3d 1341, 1346, 57 USPQ2d 
1807, 1812 (Fed. Cir. 2001)); TMEP §1209.01(b).  It is enough if a mark describes only one significant 
function, attribute, or property.  In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 
USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b); see In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 
F.3d at 1173, 71 USPQ2d at 1371.
 
The mark is CHILTOMATE SALSA ANCESTRAL (stylized) for hot sauce.  The mark is merely 
descriptive of the goods.  CHILTOMATE is a type of food.  SALSA refers to hot sauces, and the 
applicant's goods are hot sauces.  ANCESTRAL refers to food with whole ingredients without artificial 
ingredients.  The applicant's hot sauce may be ancestral salsa containing whole ingredients used to 
make chiltomate.  Please see the attached definitions and the excerpted representative articles 
describing ancestral foods including salsa, and that chiltomate is a type of food.  Therefore, the mark is 
not a source indicator of the goods. 
 
In addition, the applied-for mark shows the wording in stylized lettering. Stylized descriptive or generic 
wording is registrable only if the stylization creates a commercial impression separate and apart from 
the impression made by the wording itself. See In re Cordua Rests., Inc., 823 F.3d 594, 606, 118 
USPQ2d 1632, 1639-40 (Fed. Cir. 2016); In re Northland Aluminum Prods., Inc., 777 F.2d 1556, 1561, 
227 USPQ 961, 964 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §1209.03(w). Common and ordinary lettering with 
minimal stylization, as in this case, is generally not sufficiently striking, unique, or distinctive as to 
make an impression on purchasers separate from the wording. See In re Sadoru Grp., Ltd., 105 
USPQ2d 1484, 1487 (TTAB 2012).  
 
Two major reasons for not protecting descriptive marks are (1) to prevent the owner of a descriptive 
mark from inhibiting competition in the marketplace and (2) to avoid the possibility of costly 
infringement suits brought by the trademark or service mark owner. In re Abcor Dev. Corp., 588 F.2d 
811, 813, 200 USPQ 215, 217 (C.C.P.A. 1978); TMEP §1209. Businesses and competitors should be 
free to use descriptive language when describing their own goods and/or services to the public in 
advertising and marketing materials. See In re Styleclick.com Inc., 58 USPQ2d 1523, 1527 (TTAB 
2001). Others providing the same or similar goods would require the use of the wording(s) without fear 
of infringement suit.
 
Accordingly, the mark is not registrable on the Principal Register.
 
In addition to being merely descriptive, the applied-for mark appears to be generic in connection with 
the identified goods and/or services. “A generic mark, being the ‘ultimate in descriptiveness,’ cannot 
acquire distinctiveness” and thus is not entitled to registration on either the Principal or Supplemental 
Register under any circumstances. In re La. Fish Fry Prods., Ltd., 797 F.3d 1332, 1336, 116 USPQ2d 
1262, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int’l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc., 782 F.2d 
987, 989, 228 USPQ 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); see TMEP §§1209.01(c) et seq., 1209.02(a). 
Therefore, the trademark examining attorney cannot recommend that applicant amend the application 
to proceed under Trademark Act Section 2(f) or on the Supplemental Register as possible response 
options to this refusal. See TMEP §1209.01(c).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.Applicant should note the following additional ground for refusal. 
 
SPECIMEN
 
Specimen is merely a drawing or depiction of the mark. Registration is refused because the 
specimen is merely a photocopy of the drawing or a depiction of the applied-for mark and does not 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the goods in International Class(es) 30. 
Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (c); In 
re Chica, 84 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (TTAB 2007); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An 
application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for 
mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods and/or services identified in 
the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); 
TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following 
statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: 
“The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
the amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this 
statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.How to submit a verified specimen.
 
After opening the appropriate TEAS response form, answer “Yes” to form wizard question #2, click 
“Continue,” and provide the following for each relevant class for which a specimen is being 
submitted:
 
(1)        Under the heading “Classification and Listing of Goods/Services/Collective 
Membership Organization,” check the box next to the following statement: “Check here to 
modify the current classification number; listing of goods/services/the nature of the collective 
membership organization; dates of use; and/or filing basis; or to submit a substitute specimen, a 
foreign registration certificate, or proof of renewal of a foreign registration.  If not checked, the 
changes will be ignored.”;
 
(2)        Attach specimen under “Specimen File” (attachment may not exceed 5 
megabytes);
 
(3)        Describe in the box below that location what the attached specimen consists of;
 
(4)        Check the box below the specimen description next to the following statement (to 
ensure that the declaration language is inserted into the form): “The substitute (or new, or 
originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as 
the filing date of the application”; and
 
(5)        Follow the instructions within the form for signing. The form will require two 
signatures: one in the “Declaration Signature” section and one in the “Response Signature” 
section.
 
COLOR/DESCRIPTION OF MARK
 
Applicant must clarify the colors that are being claimed as a feature of the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 
2.52(b)(1), 2.61(b); TMEP §§807.07(a) et seq. The drawing shows the mark in the colors red, white, 
and black; however, the following colors appear in the color claim: red and black.
 
Where the color claim and/or description of the mark and drawing are inconsistent with one another, 
generally the USPTO looks to the drawing to determine what the mark is. TMEP §807.07(a)(i)-(a)(ii), 
(c). Additionally, the colors in the drawing, color claim, and description must match. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.52(b)(1); TMEP §§807.07 et seq.
 
To clarify the colors in the mark, applicant may satisfy one of the following:
 
(1)       Submit a new color drawing that shows the mark in the colors specified in the 
color claim. TMEP §807.07(c). However, any other amendments to the drawing will not be 
accepted if they would materially alter the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.72; see TMEP §§807.07(c), 
807.14 et seq. 
 
Please note if the color white in the words SALSA ANCESTRAL is merely 
transparent areas and not claimed as a feature of the mark, then the drawing can be 
maintained but the applicant must amend the description of the mark and add a statement 
that the color white represents transparent areas and is not claimed as a feature of themark.  The following may be adopted, if accurate:
 
“The mark consists of the wording "CHILTOMATE" in red outlined in black 
with the letter "C" extending below the entire wording, with the words "SALSA 
ANCESTRAL" outlined in black below.  The color white in the words "SALSA 
ANCESTRAL" represents transparent areas and is not claimed as a feature of the 
mark." 
 
(2)       Submit an amended color claim and description that matches the colors in the 
drawing. Generic color names must be used to describe the colors in the mark, e.g., red, 
yellow, blue. TMEP §807.07(a)(i)-(ii). If black, white, and/or gray represent background, 
outlining, shading, and/or transparent areas and are not part of the mark, applicant must so 
specify in the description. See TMEP §807.07(d).
 
The following color claim and description are suggested:
 
Color claim: “The colors red, black, and white are claimed as a feature of the mark.”
 
Description: “The mark consists of the wording "CHILTOMATE" in red outlined in 
black with the letter "C" extending below the entire wording, with the words 
"SALSA ANCESTRAL" in white outlined in black below.
 
For more information about drawings and instructions on how to submit a new color drawing, amended 
color claim and/or description online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) 
form, see the Drawing webpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120339
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
