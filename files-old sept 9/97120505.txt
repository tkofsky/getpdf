Correspondence Email Address:  becker-docket@fzlz.comNONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
 
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive 
•
 
 
 
SECTION 2(e)1 REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a purpose, feature or 
characteristic of applicant’s services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see 
TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, Inc., 783 
F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 
373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 
1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. 
Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
Determining the descriptiveness of a mark is done in relation to an applicant’s services, the context in 
which the mark is being used, and the possible significance the mark would have to the average 
purchaser because of the manner of its use or intended use. See In re The Chamber of Commerce of the 
U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing In re Bayer 
Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d 960, 963-64, 82 USPQ2d 1828, 1831 (Fed. Cir. 2007)); TMEP§1209.01(b). Descriptiveness of a mark is not considered in the abstract. In re Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 
488 F.3d at 963-64, 82 USPQ2d at 1831.
 
In this case, applicant has identified its services as "Investment services, namely, investment of funds; 
investment services, namely, investment management; crowdfunding services in the nature of 
providing financing from money collected from individuals; financial services, namely, financing of 
various non-traditional assets; financial services, namely, money lending" in International Class 36. 
 
A mark does not need to be merely descriptive of all the goods or services specified in an application. 
In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 
2012); In re Franklin Cnty. Historical Soc'y, 104 USPQ2d 1085, 1089 (TTAB 2012). “A 
descriptiveness refusal is proper ‘if the mark is descriptive of any of the [goods or] services for which 
registration is sought.’” In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d at 1300, 102 USPQ2d at 
1219 (quoting In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1040, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005)).
 
The attached evidence from American Heritage Dictionary shows that "INVEST" means "to commit 
(money or capital) in order to gain a financial return"; BEYOND" is a preposition meaning "in addition 
to"; "THE" is a definite article "used before singular or plural nouns and noun phrases that denote 
particular, specified persons or things"; and "STOCK MARKET" means "the market in which stocks 
are bought and sold, usually including the organized exchanges and over-the-counter markets in a 
particular country or economic region."  Thus, "INVEST" describes a purpose, feature, or characteristic 
of applicant's investment and financial services because the services are for assisting consumers with 
committing money or capital in order to gain a financial return.  The wording "BEYOND THE STOCK 
MARKET" describes a feature or characteristic of applicant's investment and financial services because 
the services presumably involve assets that are in addition to stocks that are bought and sold in a 
particular market, such as the U.S. stock market.  Indeed, the attached evidence from Apple Podcasts 
and Pod Me indicate that applicant does provide services related to investments in alternative assets 
other than in the stock market.  For example, Apple Podcasts shows a podcast provided by applicant 
which states: "We have a clear goal- to help you find new ways to break the mold and invest beyond 
the stock market potentially achieving greater rewards" (emphasis added).  Likewise, Pod 
Me advertises applicant's services as follows:  "Yieldstreet allows you to invest beyond the stock 
market with an evolving marketplace of alternative investments" (emphasis added). 
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not registrable. In re 
Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re Tower Tech, Inc., 64 
USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. 
Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding 
SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as hypodermic, 
aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 (TTAB 
2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner that is an 
integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services is the combined mark registrable. See In re 
Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 
549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In 
re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services. 
Specifically, the wording "INVEST BEYOND THE STOCK MARKET" merely describes a purpose, 
feature or characteristic of applicant's services because applicant's investment and financial services are 
for assisting consumers with committing money or capital in assets that are in addition to stocks that 
are bought and sold in a particular market for the purpose of obtaining a financial return.  See also the 
attached evidence from Regions, Rich and Regular, Newswire, Bungalow, Equity Trust, Reidoc Capital, 
and Linkedin showing third-parties using the wording "INVEST BEYOND THE STOCK MARKET" 
to refer to the act of committing money or capital to alternative assets other than stocks. 
 
Therefore, applicant's mark is refused registration under Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act.
 
Although applicant's mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Supplemental Register Advisory - Section 2(e)(1) Refusal
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register. Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816. Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant 
from submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal(s). TMEP §816.04.

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
