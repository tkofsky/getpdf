NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKSThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
            • Specimen Required 
            • Section 1(a) and 45 Refusal - Premature Use
 
SPECIMEN REQUIRED 
 
Advertising for goods is not an acceptable specimen. Registration is refused because the specimen 
appears to be mere advertising and does not properly show the applied-for mark as actually used in 
commerce in International Classes 29 and 30. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.04(b), 904.07(a). An application based on 
Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in 
commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 
C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Specifically, applicant submitted what applicant describes as "marketing and promotional materials".
 
Advertising is not acceptable as a specimen for goods. See In re Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 
USPQ2d 265039, at *15-16 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re Siny Corp., 920 F.3d 1331, 1336, 2019 
USPQ2d 127099, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. 2019)); see also Avakoff v. S. Pac. Co., 765 F.2d 1097, 1098, 226 
USPQ 435, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §904.04(b), (c). Advertising includes online advertising 
banners appearing on search-engine results pages or in social media, advertising circulars and 
brochures, price lists, and business cards. See TMEP §904.04(b).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c).  Any webpage 
printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was 
accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a 
verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application and (b) 
shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the goods identified in the application. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following 
statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: 
“The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were inuse in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
the amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this 
statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b), as no specimen is 
required before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
 
Applicant should note the following additional ground for refusal.
 
SECTION 1(a) AND 45 REFUSAL - PREMATURE USE 
 
Registration is refused because the specimen shows that applicant has not used the applied-for mark in 
commerce in connection with the identified goods as of the application filing date. Trademark Act 
Sections 1(a) and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051(a), 1127; 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(1)(i); see TMEP §§904, 
1301.03(a)-(b).
 
Specifically, the specimen states "Our recipes are in their final te[s]t phase, we hope that you might 
help [u]s by taste testing the enclosed samples" and "We are working on our website and online store to 
make our hot and cold individual serving breakfast packets available for online purchase." These 
statements indicate that the goods are not yet being offered in commerce. 
 
The use or display of a mark in the sale or advertising of goods before the goods are actually created or 
provided does not show use in commerce. See Couture v. Playdom, Inc., 778 F.3d 1379, 1380-82, 113 
USPQ2d 2042, 2043-44 (Fed. Cir. 2015); In re Suuberg, 2021 USPQ2d 1209, *7-8 (TTAB 2021); 
TMEP §§904, 1301.03(a)-(b).
 
If applicant’s goods were being sold or transported in commerce as of the application filing date, 
applicant must submit the following:
 
(1)        A different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) showing the applied-
for mark in use in commerce for the goods specified in the application. Any webpage 
printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits 
the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a 
later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(2)        The following statement, verified with an affidavit or signed declaration 
under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute specimen was in use in commerce at least as 
early as the application filing date.” 37 C.F.R. §2.59(a); TMEP §904.05; see 37 C.F.R. 
§2.193(e)(1). If submitting a substitute specimen requires an amendment to the dates of 
use, applicant must also verify the amended dates. 37 C.F.R. §2.71(c); TMEP §904.05.
 
If applicant did not use the applied-for mark in commerce on or before the filing date, applicant maysubstitute a different basis for filing if applicant can meet the requirements for the new basis. In this 
case, applicant may wish to amend the application to assert a Section 1(b) basis. See TMEP §806.03(c). 
However, if applicant amends the basis to Section 1(b), registration will not be granted until applicant 
later amends the application back to use in commerce by filing an acceptable allegation of use with a 
proper specimen. See 15 U.S.C. §1051(c), (d); 37 C.F.R. §§2.76, 2.88; TMEP §1103. If the same 
specimen is submitted with an allegation of use, the same refusal will issue.
 
To amend to Section 1(b), applicant must submit the following statement, verified with an affidavit or 
signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “Applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in 
commerce and had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the application filing 
date.” 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2); TMEP §806.01(b); see 15 U.S.C. §1051(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.35(b)(1), 
2.193(e)(1).

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
