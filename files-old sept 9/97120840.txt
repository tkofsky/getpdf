SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02. 
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Identification of Goods and Services - Amendment Required (Partial Requirement)
•
Multiple-Class Application Requirements
•
Mark Description - Amendment Required
•
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES - AMENDMENT REQUIRED (PARTIAL 
REQUIREMENT)
 
THIS PARTIAL REQUIREMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE GOODS AND SERVICES SPECIFIED 
THEREIN
 
Particular wording in the U.S. application’s identification of goods and/or services has been found to 
exceed the scope of the goods and/or services in the foreign registration upon which the U.S. 
application relies. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. For a U.S. application 
based on Trademark Act Section 44(e), an applicant is required to list only goods and/or services that 
are within the scope of the goods and/or services in the foreign registration. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §§1012, 1402.01(b). Therefore, this wording is not considered part of the identification of goods 
and/or services in the U.S. application, and only the remaining wording in the identification is operativefor purposes of future amendment. See TMEP §1402.01(b); cf. TMEP §1402.07(d).
 
In this case, the U.S. application identifies the particular goods and/or services as follows: "Computer 
operating programs" and 
"Entertainment services for sharing audio and video recordings." However, the foreign registration 
identifies 
the 
following 
goods 
and/or 
services: 
"Computer 
operating 
programs [recorded]" and "Photosharing and video sharing services."
 
These goods and/or services in the U.S. application exceed the scope of the goods and/or services in the 
foreign registration because the goods do not include the limiting wording "[recorded]" and services 
include "sharing audio . . . recordings" instead of "photosharing". Thus, these goods and/or services in 
the U.S. application are not acceptable.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Limiting the identification of goods and/or services in the U.S. application to 
correspond to the goods and/or services in the foreign registration and not exceeding the 
scope of the initial or acceptably amended identification in the U.S. application, and/or 
deleting from the U.S. application all goods and/or services beyond the scope of the 
foreign registration; or
(2)        Substituting a basis under Section 1(a) or 1(b) for those goods and/or services in 
the U.S. application that are beyond the scope of the foreign registration. An applicant may 
assert more than one basis in an application (except Section 1(a) and 1(b) may not be 
asserted for the same goods and/or services), provided all requirements are satisfied for 
each claimed basis.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(a)-(b), 1126; 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(6), 2.34(b), 2.35(b); Marmark Ltd. v. Nutrexpa 
S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845 (TTAB 1989); TMEP §§806.02, 806.03(h), 1402.01(b).
 
Additionally, applicant may respond by arguing that these goods and/or services are within the scope of 
the foreign registration and should remain in the U.S. application.
 
Applicant must clarify the wording "telecommunications" in the identification of goods and/or services 
in International Class(es) 38 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make sufficiently clear what type of 
services encompassed, e.g., telecommunications consultation, telecommunication access services, 
digital network telecommunications services, telecommunications gateway services, etc. Further, this 
wording could identify goods and/or services in more than one international class. For example, 
telecommunications consultation are in International Class 38 and telecommunications technology 
consultancy are in International Class 42.
 
The identification for computer programs in International Class 9 is indefinite and too broad and must 
be clarified to specify whether the format is downloadable, recorded, or online non-downloadable. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). Downloadable and recorded goods are in 
International Class 9, whereas providing their temporary, online non-downloadable use is a service in 
International Class 42. See TMEP §1402.03(d).
 
Applicant must clarify the wording "entertainment services for sharing video recordings" in the 
identification of services in International Class 41, "computer hardware . . . consultancy", "socialscience consultancy", "provision of technical consultancy" in International Class 42, "rehabilitation 
centres", "dental services" in International Class 44 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make 
clear what the specific services are. Further, this wording could identify services in more than one 
international class. For example, the wording "entertainment services for sharing video 
recordings" may 
encompass video-on-demand 
transmission 
services 
in 
International 
Class 
38, providing non-downloadable films via video-on-demand transmission services in International 
Class 41, and providing a web site featuring temporary use of non-downloadable software allowing 
web site users to upload, post and display online videos for sharing with others for entertainment 
purposes in International Class 42.
 
The identification for computer programs/software in International Class 9 is indefinite and must be 
clarified to specify the purpose or function of the software and its content or field of use, if content- or 
field- specific. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). The USPTO requires such 
specificity in order for a trademark examining attorney to examine the application properly and make 
appropriate decisions concerning possible conflicts between the applicant’s mark and other marks. See 
In re N.A.D. Inc., 57 USPQ2d 1872, 1874 (TTAB 2000); TMEP §1402.03(d).
 
The wording "integrated circuit chips", "compact discs (audio-video)", "data carriers, included in class 
9, computer programs and data collections recorded on the aforesaid data carriers", "digital picture 
frames", "floppy discs", "printers for computers", "cinematographic apparatus", "magnetic tapes", 
"monitors (computer programs)", "optical data carriers", "optical disc", "disc exchangers (for 
computers)", "roentgen films, exposed", "radiology screens for industrial purposes", "providing access 
to computer programs on data networks", "providing access to and transmission of information and 
providing access to online data services and information on the Internet", "electronic exchange of 
messages via chat lines, chatrooms and Internet forums", "news agencies", "providing wireless 
telecommunications connections to global computer networks and other communications networks", 
"transmission of messages and data via wireless digital networks", "arranging and conducting of 
conferences; arranging and conducting of seminars", "providing computer, electronic and online 
databases for educational, recreational and amusement use in the field of entertainment and in the 
fields of secondary, collegiate, social and community interest groups", "publication of electronic 
journals and web logs, featuring user generated or specified content", "digital image processing 
(graphic design)", "computer animation", "scientific reports; technical research", "implementation of 
computer programs on networks; configuring computer networks by means of software", "maintenance 
and installation of software", "research in databases and on the Internet for science and research", 
"out-patient services", "aromatherapy", "pharmacy advice", "public baths; hospices", "services of 
medical institutions for hospital care", "hospitals", "sanitary services . . . and sanatoriums", "medical 
and clinical examinations", "conducting technical project studies", "maintenance of software", 
"computer services, namely, creating virtual communities for registered users to organize groups and 
events, participate in discussions, and engage in social, business and community networking" in the 
identification of goods/services is indefinite and must be clarified because it does not sufficiently 
identify the specific type, function or purpose of goods/services encompassed. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. For example, it is unclear whether the wording "compact discs (audio-
video)" encompasses blank combat discs or compact discs featuring music, etc. Similarly, the 
wording "floppy discs"  is indefinite because descriptions of floppy computer discs must indicate that 
the goods are blank, if accurate, and descriptions of recorded floppy computer discs must indicate the 
function of the recorded software programs.
 
The identification of goods and/or services contains parentheses and brackets. Generally, an applicantshould not use parentheses and brackets, including curly brackets, in identifications in order to avoid 
confusion with the USPTO’s practice of using parentheses and brackets in registrations to indicate (1) 
goods and/or services that have been deleted from registrations, (2) goods and/or services not claimed 
in an affidavit of incontestability, or (3) guidance to users of the USPTO’s U.S. Acceptable 
Identification of Goods and Services Manual to draft an acceptable identification. See TMEP 
§§1402.04, 1402.12. The only exception for including parenthetical information in identifications is if 
it serves to explain or translate the matter immediately preceding the parenthetical phrase in such a way 
that it does not affect the clarity or scope of the identification, e.g., “fried tofu pieces (abura-age).” See 
TMEP §1402.12. Therefore, applicant must remove the parentheses and brackets from the 
identification and incorporate any parenthetical or bracketed information into the description of the 
goods and/or services.
 
Applicant is advised to delete or modify the duplicate entry in the identification of goods in 
International Class 9 for “computers" and services in International Class 38 for "transmission of 
electronic mail" and International Class 42 for "computer programming". See generally TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.01(a). If applicant does not respond to this issue, be advised that the USPTO will 
remove duplicate entries from the identification prior to registration.  If modifying one of the duplicate 
entries, applicant may amend it to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden or 
expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Also, generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not 
later be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).

Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the U.S. application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found in or encompassed by those in the original U.S. 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e). Additionally, for U.S. 
applications filed under Trademark Act Section 44(e), the scope of the identification for purposes of 
permissible amendments may not exceed the scope of the goods and/or services identified in the 
foreign registration.  37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); Marmark, Ltd. v. Nutrexpa, S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845(TTAB 1989) (citing In re Löwenbräu München, 175 USPQ 178, 181 (TTAB 1972)); TMEP §§1012, 
1402.01(b).

SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Identification of Goods and Services - Amendment Required (Partial Requirement)
•
Multiple-Class Application Requirements
•
Mark Description - Amendment Required
•
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES - AMENDMENT REQUIRED (PARTIAL 
REQUIREMENT)
 
THIS PARTIAL REQUIREMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE GOODS AND SERVICES SPECIFIED 
THEREIN
 
Particular wording in the U.S. application’s identification of goods and/or services has been found to 
exceed the scope of the goods and/or services in the foreign registration upon which the U.S. 
application relies. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. For a U.S. application 
based on Trademark Act Section 44(e), an applicant is required to list only goods and/or services that 
are within the scope of the goods and/or services in the foreign registration. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §§1012, 1402.01(b). Therefore, this wording is not considered part of the identification of goods 
and/or services in the U.S. application, and only the remaining wording in the identification is operative 
for purposes of future amendment. See TMEP §1402.01(b); cf. TMEP §1402.07(d).
 
In this case, the U.S. application identifies the particular goods and/or services as follows: "Computer 
operating programs" and 
"Entertainment services for sharing audio and video recordings." However, the foreign registration 
identifies 
the 
following 
goods 
and/or 
services: 
"Computer 
operating 
programs [recorded]" and "Photosharing and video sharing services."
 
These goods and/or services in the U.S. application exceed the scope of the goods and/or services in the 
foreign registration because the goods do not include the limiting wording "[recorded]" and services 
include "sharing audio . . . recordings" instead of "photosharing". Thus, these goods and/or services in 
the U.S. application are not acceptable.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Limiting the identification of goods and/or services in the U.S. application to 
correspond to the goods and/or services in the foreign registration and not exceeding the 
scope of the initial or acceptably amended identification in the U.S. application, and/or 
deleting from the U.S. application all goods and/or services beyond the scope of the 
foreign registration; or
(2)        Substituting a basis under Section 1(a) or 1(b) for those goods and/or services in 
the U.S. application that are beyond the scope of the foreign registration. An applicant may 
assert more than one basis in an application (except Section 1(a) and 1(b) may not be 
asserted for the same goods and/or services), provided all requirements are satisfied for 
each claimed basis.See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(a)-(b), 1126; 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(6), 2.34(b), 2.35(b); Marmark Ltd. v. Nutrexpa 
S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845 (TTAB 1989); TMEP §§806.02, 806.03(h), 1402.01(b).
 
Additionally, applicant may respond by arguing that these goods and/or services are within the scope of 
the foreign registration and should remain in the U.S. application.
 
Applicant must clarify the wording "telecommunications" in the identification of goods and/or services 
in International Class(es) 38 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make sufficiently clear what type of 
services encompassed, e.g., telecommunications consultation, telecommunication access services, 
digital network telecommunications services, telecommunications gateway services, etc. Further, this 
wording could identify goods and/or services in more than one international class. For example, 
telecommunications consultation are in International Class 38 and telecommunications technology 
consultancy are in International Class 42.
 
The identification for computer programs in International Class 9 is indefinite and too broad and must 
be clarified to specify whether the format is downloadable, recorded, or online non-downloadable. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). Downloadable and recorded goods are in 
International Class 9, whereas providing their temporary, online non-downloadable use is a service in 
International Class 42. See TMEP §1402.03(d).
 
Applicant must clarify the wording "entertainment services for sharing video recordings" in the 
identification of services in International Class 41, "computer hardware . . . consultancy", "social 
science consultancy", "provision of technical consultancy" in International Class 42, "rehabilitation 
centres", "dental services" in International Class 44 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make 
clear what the specific services are. Further, this wording could identify services in more than one 
international class. For example, the wording "entertainment services for sharing video 
recordings" may 
encompass video-on-demand 
transmission 
services 
in 
International 
Class 
38, providing non-downloadable films via video-on-demand transmission services in International 
Class 41, and providing a web site featuring temporary use of non-downloadable software allowing 
web site users to upload, post and display online videos for sharing with others for entertainment 
purposes in International Class 42.
 
The identification for computer programs/software in International Class 9 is indefinite and must be 
clarified to specify the purpose or function of the software and its content or field of use, if content- or 
field- specific. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). The USPTO requires such 
specificity in order for a trademark examining attorney to examine the application properly and make 
appropriate decisions concerning possible conflicts between the applicant’s mark and other marks. See 
In re N.A.D. Inc., 57 USPQ2d 1872, 1874 (TTAB 2000); TMEP §1402.03(d).
 
The wording "integrated circuit chips", "compact discs (audio-video)", "data carriers, included in class 
9, computer programs and data collections recorded on the aforesaid data carriers", "digital picture 
frames", "floppy discs", "printers for computers", "cinematographic apparatus", "magnetic tapes", 
"monitors (computer programs)", "optical data carriers", "optical disc", "disc exchangers (for 
computers)", "roentgen films, exposed", "radiology screens for industrial purposes", "providing access 
to computer programs on data networks", "providing access to and transmission of information and 
providing access to online data services and information on the Internet", "electronic exchange ofmessages via chat lines, chatrooms and Internet forums", "news agencies", "providing wireless 
telecommunications connections to global computer networks and other communications networks", 
"transmission of messages and data via wireless digital networks", "arranging and conducting of 
conferences; arranging and conducting of seminars", "providing computer, electronic and online 
databases for educational, recreational and amusement use in the field of entertainment and in the 
fields of secondary, collegiate, social and community interest groups", "publication of electronic 
journals and web logs, featuring user generated or specified content", "digital image processing 
(graphic design)", "computer animation", "scientific reports; technical research", "implementation of 
computer programs on networks; configuring computer networks by means of software", "maintenance 
and installation of software", "research in databases and on the Internet for science and research", 
"out-patient services", "aromatherapy", "pharmacy advice", "public baths; hospices", "services of 
medical institutions for hospital care", "hospitals", "sanitary services . . . and sanatoriums", "medical 
and clinical examinations" in the identification of goods/services is indefinite and must be clarified 
because it does not sufficiently identify the specific type, function or purpose of goods/services 
encompassed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. For example, it is unclear whether the 
wording "compact discs (audio-video)" encompasses blank combat discs or compact discs featuring 
music, etc. Similarly, the wording "floppy discs"  is indefinite because descriptions of floppy computer 
discs must indicate that the goods are blank, if accurate, and descriptions of recorded floppy computer 
discs must indicate the function of the recorded software programs.
 
The identification of goods and/or services contains parentheses and brackets. Generally, an applicant 
should not use parentheses and brackets, including curly brackets, in identifications in order to avoid 
confusion with the USPTO’s practice of using parentheses and brackets in registrations to indicate (1) 
goods and/or services that have been deleted from registrations, (2) goods and/or services not claimed 
in an affidavit of incontestability, or (3) guidance to users of the USPTO’s U.S. Acceptable 
Identification of Goods and Services Manual to draft an acceptable identification. See TMEP 
§§1402.04, 1402.12. The only exception for including parenthetical information in identifications is if 
it serves to explain or translate the matter immediately preceding the parenthetical phrase in such a way 
that it does not affect the clarity or scope of the identification, e.g., “fried tofu pieces (abura-age).” See 
TMEP §1402.12. Therefore, applicant must remove the parentheses and brackets from the 
identification and incorporate any parenthetical or bracketed information into the description of the 
goods and/or services.
 
Applicant is advised to delete or modify the duplicate entry in the identification of goods in 
International Class 9 for “computers" and services in International Class 38 for "transmission of 
electronic mail" and International Class 42 for "computer programming". See generally TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.01(a). If applicant does not respond to this issue, be advised that the USPTO will 
remove duplicate entries from the identification prior to registration.  If modifying one of the duplicate 
entries, applicant may amend it to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden or 
expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Also, generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not 
later be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).

Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the U.S. application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found in or encompassed by those in the original U.S. 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e). Additionally, for U.S. 
applications filed under Trademark Act Section 44(e), the scope of the identification for purposes of 
permissible amendments may not exceed the scope of the goods and/or services identified in the 
foreign registration.  37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); Marmark, Ltd. v. Nutrexpa, S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845

MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 44:
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120840
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
