NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 22, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Search ResultsThe trademark examining attorney has searched the Office’s database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).
 
Definite Identification of Goods and Services Requirement
 
The identification of services in Class 36 is accepted.
 
Wording in the identification of goods and services is (1) indefinite and must be clarified, (2) overbroad 
in that it encompasses goods/services in more than one international classification and/or (3) 
misclassified. See TMEP §1402.01.
 
The word “clothing” in the identification of goods is indefinite and too broad and must be clarified 
because the word does not make clear the nature of the goods and could identify goods in more than 
one international class. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. The following are 
examples of acceptable identifications: “clothing for protection against accidents, irradiation and fire” 
in International Class 9; “surgical gowns” in International Class 10; “pet clothing” in International 
Class 18; and “shirts,” “shorts,” and “pants” in International Class 25. Therefore, applicant must amend 
the identification to specify the type of clothing. If applicant’s “clothing” is in International Class 25, 
applicant may amend the identification to insert the word “namely,” after “clothing” and then list the 
specific types of clothing items in that class (e.g., shirts, pants, coats, dresses).
 
Please see suggested identification below for specific wording that requires clarification and/or 
reclassification. 
Please 
note 
that 
bolded 
wording/punctuation 
indicates 
a 
suggested 
addition(s)/amendment(s) to applicant’s current identification to make it definite.   In addition, please 
note that the bracketed entries below require applicant to insert information. Finally, please note that 
the suggested identification may include additional international classifications and, if applicant adopts 
these suggested identifications, applicant will need to comply with the requirements set forth in the 
multiple class requirements section below.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 09:  Downloadable music files authenticated by non-fungible tokens (NFTs); Downloadable 
multimedia file containing [specify, e.g., artwork, text, audio, and video] relating to [indicate field 
or subject matter of file] authenticated by non-fungible tokens (NFTs); Downloadable software for

Additions to Identification Not Permitted
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06.  Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended.  See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b).  The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification.  TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b).  Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted.  TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
To expedite prosecution of this trademark application, when amending the identification as required 
above, the Office strongly encourages the applicant to select pre-approved wording contained within 
this manual that accurately describes the goods and/or services therein.  Failure to do so may result in 
delay.
 
Section 1(b) Requirements for Combined Applications
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already 
paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or 
services that are classified in at least 7 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) 
sufficient for only 5 class(es).  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes 
not covered by the submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classescovered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
