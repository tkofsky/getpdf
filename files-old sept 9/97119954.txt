INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.

SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
•
 
 
CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
 
Applicant has classified “Operating, managing, and maintaining a web-based marketplace for 
identifying new contractor partners and project leads in connection with facilities construction and 
operation” in International Class 045; however, the proper classification, properly amended, is 
International Class 035. Therefore, applicant may respond by (1) adding International Class 035 to the 
application and reclassifying these goods and/or services in the proper international class, (2) deleting 
“Operating, managing, and maintaining a web-based marketplace for identifying new contractor 
partners and project leads in connection with facilities construction and operation” from the application, 
or (3) deleting the remainder of the items in the identification and reclassifying the specified goods 
and/or services in the proper international class. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.86(a), 6.1; TMEP §§1403.02 et seq. 
If applicant adds one or more international classes to the application, applicant must comply with the 
multiple-class requirements specified in this Office action.
 
The identification of services is indefinite and too broad because it references providing online 
information services without indicating the subject matter of such information and could identify 
services in more than one international class. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03, 
1402.11(a)(ii). The subject matter of the information being provided determines classification of these 
services. TMEP §1402.11(a)(ii). For example, “providing information in the field of real estate via the 
Internet” is classified in International Class 36; “providing consumer product information via the 
Internet” is classified in International Class 35; and “providing information in the fields of forensic 
science via the Internet” is classified in International Class 42.
 
Therefore, applicant must amend the identification to specify the subject matter of the information 
being provided via the Internet, and the proper classification. Id.
 
Applicant may adopt the following wording, if accurate (suggestions in bold italics, deletions in 
strikethrough): 
 
“Provision of an online marketplace for buyers and sellers of construction services, namely, 
identifying new contractor partners and project leads in connection with facilities construction and 
operation” in International Class 035.  
 
“Providing financial viability risk information in the field of facilities construction and contracting 
via a website” in International Class 036.“Providing facilities construction and contracting information related to sustainability, and quality 
via a website” in International Class 037.
 
“Non Downloadable Software made available on a software as a service basis Software as a Service 
(SaaS) services featuring non-downloadable software for gathering and assessing information 
pertaining to facilities construction and operation, namely, safety risk information, financial viability 
risk information, sustainability information, and quality information, both during the construction phase 
of the facility and during its operations” in International Class 042.
 
“Providing information in the field of construction and contractor safety via a website Operating, 
managing, and maintaining a web-based network for furnishing information pertaining to facilities 
construction and contracting and facilities operation, namely, information related to safety risks, 
financial viability risks, sustainability, and quality; Operating, managing, and maintaining a web-
based marketplace for identifying new contractor partners and project leads in connection with 
facilities construction and operation” in International Class 045.
Scope Advisory 
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Multiple-Class Application Requirements 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that 
are classified in at least five (5) classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 
two (2) class(es).  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the 
submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already 
paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
