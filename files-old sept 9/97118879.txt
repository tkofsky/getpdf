NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below to enable further prosecution of the 
application. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Description of the mark and color claim 
 
Although applicant submitted a drawing showing the mark in color with a color claim, applicant did not 
provide the required description that specifies where each color appears in the literal and design 
elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). Therefore, applicant 
must provide this description. See TMEP §807.07(a)(ii).
 
Generic color names must be used to describe the colors in the mark, e.g., red, yellow, blue.  TMEP 
§807.07(a)(i)-(ii). If black, white, and/or gray represent background, outlining, shading, and/or 
transparent areas and are not part of the mark, applicant must so specify in the description. See TMEP 
§807.07(d).
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate:  The mark consists of of the words 
"JUSTBREATHE" in black where there is a yellow drop in the "u" and the words "RELAX AND 
RECHARGE" in black under the  word"BREATHE"."
 
Although applicant submitted a color drawing with a description referencing colors in the mark, 
applicant did not provide a list of all the colors claimed as a feature of the mark, known as a color 
claim. Therefore, applicant must provide this required color claim. 37 C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1); see TMEP 
§§807.07(a) et seq.  
 
Specifically, the color white, which is enclosed in the drop is not specified as a feature or just 
background.  It appears on the use that the white is only background.  As such, the following color 
claim is suggested, if accurate: “The colors black and yellow are claimed as a feature of the mark.  
The color white is only background and is not part of the mark.  ” TMEP §807.07(a)(i).
 
If the color white is meant to be part of the yellow drop, applicant must claim the colors black, white 
and yellow.

number and e-mail address (if applicable), and (5) the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.194(b)(1); TMEP §302.03(a). 
 
If applicant does not respond to this Office action within six months of the issue/mailing date, or 
responds by expressly abandoning the application, the application process will end and the trademark 
will fail to register. See 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.65(a), 2.68(a); TMEP §§718.01, 718.02. 
Additionally, the USPTO will not refund the application filing fee, which is a required processing

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
