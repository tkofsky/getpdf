Correspondence Address:  
NYALL ENGFIELD 
16950 VIA DE SANTA FE SUITE 5060-107 
RANCHO SANTA FE CA 92067 UNITED STATES
Applicant:  Peachtree Woodworking Supply Inc
Reference/Docket No. MAGFU-003
Correspondence Email Address:  trademarks@myamazonguy.comNONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
2(e)(2) - Primarily Geographically Descriptive
•
Claim of Acquired Distinctiveness Unacceptable - Generic Term
•
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02. 
 
SECTION 2(e)(2) REFUSAL - PRIMARILY GEOGRAPHICALLY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is primarily geographically descriptive of the 
origin of applicant’s goods, namely, "dust removing installations for cleaning purposes; Dust 
separators; Dust exhausting installations for cleaning purposes". Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2), 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); see TMEP §§1210, 1210.01(a).
 
A mark is primarily geographically descriptive when the following is demonstrated:
 
(1)        The primary significance of the mark to the purchasing public is a generally known 
location;
 
(2)       The goods or services originate in the place identified in the mark; and
 
(3)       The purchasing public would be likely to believe that the goods or services 
originate in the geographic place identified in the mark; that is, to make a goods-place or 
services-place association.
 
See Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *5 (TTAB 2020) (citing 
In re Nantucket, Inc., 677 F.2d 95, 96-97, 213 USPQ 889, 891 (C.C.P.A. 1982)); see also In re 
Newbridge Cutlery Co., 776 F.3d 854, 860-61, 113 USPQ2d 1445, 1448-49 (Fed. Cir. 2015); In re 
Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1452 (Fed. 
Cir. 1987); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 (TTAB 2001)); TMEP §1210.01(a).The examining attorney refers to the definitions of the term “woodworking,” “tool” and “woodworking 
tools” resulting from the examining attorney’s search in a global computer network dictionary. See attached.
 
Definition No. 1: WOODWORKING - The act, art, or trade of working with wood.
 
Definition No. 2: TOOLS - any instrument or simple piece of equipment that you hold in your 
hands and use to do a particular kind of work
 
Definition No. 3: WOODWORKING TOOLS - the essential tools for woodworking that let users 
hone their craft
 
In other words, the plain meaning of the words "WOODWORKING TOOLS" describes the field and 
function, as well as the purpose and intended use of the goods for which protection is sought. 
 
Moreover, the applicant submitted specimens of use, one of which contains the following statement 
thereon: "2 1/2" x 20' Clear PVC Dust Collection Hose For Use with Dust Collectors with 2-1/2" Ports. 
Ideal for Shop Vaccums." Evidence shows that "dust collectors" and "shop vacuums" are categorized as 
"woodworking tools" by industry participants.

Here, the asserted mark includes the geographic reference "FULTON".  Further, the initial application specifies 
that the applicant is located in "Peachtree Corners, Georgia," which borders "Fulton County."  
 
See attached from:

("Peachtree Corners GA Zip Code | Peachtree Corners City, Fulton County Zip Code")
 
https://www.indeed.com/q-Fulton-County-Ga-l-Peachtree-Corners,-GA-

("Fulton County Ga jobs in Peachtree Corners, GA")
 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peachtree_Corners,_Georgia
("Peachtree Corners is located in the western corner of Gwinnett County, 21 miles (33 km) from 
downtown Atlanta. Seven miles of the Chattahoochee River define the northern and western 
border of Peachtree Corners, and it is bordered by the cities of Dunwoody, Doraville, and Sandy 
Springs (DeKalb and Fulton counties) on the west, Buford Highway and Norcross city limits on 
the south, Roswell and Johns Creek (both in Fulton County) across the Chattahoochee River on 
the north, and the city limits of Berkeley Lake and Duluth on the east...") (citations omitted)
 
As such, it is reasonable to conclude the geographic reference "FULTON COUNTY" pertains to the "FULTON" 
reference in the initial application specifying the applicant's location as well as the geographic origin of the 
goods. 
 
If the most prominent meaning or significance of a mark is geographic for the goods in the application, 
the fact that the mark may have other meanings in other contexts does not alter its geographic 
significance in the context of the application. See In re Opryland USA Inc., 1 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-13 
(TTAB 1986) (holding the mark THE NASHVILLE NETWORK primarily geographically descriptive 
of television program production and distribution services when finding that the primary significance ofthe term referred to Nashville, Tennessee and not that of a style of music); In re Cookie Kitchen, Inc., 
228 USPQ 873, 874 (TTAB 1986) (noting that where MANHATTAN refers to a type of cocktail and to 
a geographic location that having an alternative meaning does not alter the mark’s primary geographic 
significance in the context of the goods in the application); In re Jack’s Hi-Grade Foods, Inc., 226 
USPQ 1028, 1029 (TTAB 1985) (noting that where NEAPOLITAN refers to a type of ice cream and 
also means “pertaining to Naples, Italy” that having an alternative meaning does not alter the mark’s 
primary geographic significance in the context of the goods in the application); TMEP §1210.02(b)(i).
 
In addition, the addition of generic or highly descriptive wording to a geographic word or term does not 
diminish that geographic word or term’s primary geographic significance. TMEP §1210.02(c)(ii); see, 
e.g., Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *6-7 (TTAB 2020) 
(holding CHARLESTON HARBOR TOURS primarily geographically descriptive of various travel 
tour and cruise services because TOURS is generic for the services and CHARLESTON HARBOR is a 
well-known harbor in Charleston, South Carolina); In re Hollywood Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 
1852, 1853-54 (TTAB 2014) (holding HOLLYWOOD LAWYERS ONLINE primarily geographically 
descriptive of attorney referrals, online business information, and an online business directory).
 
Marks comprising geographic wording coupled with additional wording and/or design elements must 
be considered as a whole and should not be dissected; however, a trademark examining attorney may 
consider the significance of each element separately in the course of evaluating the mark as a whole. 
See In re Save Venice N.Y. Inc., 259 F.3d 1346, 1352, 59 USPQ2d 1778, 1782 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing 
In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). Greater weight 
may be accorded the dominant feature. See In re Wada, 194 F.3d 1297, 1300, 52 USPQ2d 1539, 1541 
(Fed. Cir. 1999).
 
"FULTON WOODWORKING TOOLS" is primarily geographically descriptive of woodworking tools 
produced in or near the geographic location of the county of "FULTON," which borders "Peachtree 
Corners" in Georgia, the stated location of applicant as set forth in the initial application. That is, the 
primary 
significance 
of 
the 
mark 
to 
the 
purchasing 
public 
is 
a 
generally 
known 
location, "FULTON"; the goods originate in the place identified in the mark, according to the initial 
application; and, consumers are likelyto make a goods-place being that the owner makes the following 
statement on its website:
 
Peachtree Woodworking Supply Inc. is a small woodworking supply company, based 
out of Atlanta, Georgia. As you surf through our web site you will find a great 
selection and various ideas for your own woodworking shop. Our goal is to provide 
you with the hard to find woodworking tools and accessories.

("Peachtree Woodworking Supply Inc. is a small woodworking supply company, based out of 
Atlanta, Georgia. As you surf through our web site you will find a great selection and various 
ideas for your own woodworking shop. Our goal is to provide you with the hard to find 
woodworking tools and accessories.")
 
The applicant should note in particular the statement, "Our goal is to provide you with the hard to find 
woodworking tools and accessories," as the statement evinces generic use of the term "woodworking 
tools," namely, the type of tools provided by the applicant to consumers in a more localized manner,consistent with others in the industry that offer tools, for which the applicant claims it has acquired 
distinctiveness. See below. 
 
For the above-noted reasons, the application is refused registration for being primarily descriptive in 
relation to the goods.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
SECTION 2(f) ACQUIRED DISTINCTIVENESS
 
Applicant asserted a claim of acquired distinctiveness under Trademark Act Section 2(f) based on use 
of the mark in commerce with the goods and/or services for five years prior to the date on which the 
claim is made. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(f). However, as the attached evidence demonstrates, the allegation 
of five years’ use is insufficient to show acquired distinctiveness because the applied-for mark is highly 
descriptive, if not generic, of applicant’s goods. See In re La. Fish Fry Prods., Ltd., 797 F.3d 1332, 
1336-37, 116 USPQ2d 1262, 1265 (Fed. Cir. 2015); In re Virtual Indep. Paralegals, LLC, 2019 
USPQ2d 111512, at *11-12 (TTAB 2019); TMEP §1212.05(a). An applicant’s evidentiary burden of 
showing acquired distinctiveness increases with the level of descriptiveness of the mark sought to be 
registered; as in this case, a more descriptive term requires more evidence. Royal Crown Co. v. Coca-
Cola Co., 892 F.3d 1358, 1365, 127 USPQ2d 1041, 1045 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1300, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1424 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); In re GJ & AM, 
LLC, 2021 USPQ2d 617, at *37-38 (TTAB 2021). As the mark in this case is highly descriptive, 
applicant’s evidence is not sufficient to show acquired distinctiveness.
 
Applicant may respond by providing additional evidence of acquired distinctiveness, such as verified 
statements of long-term use, advertising and sales expenditures, examples of advertising, affidavits and 
declarations of consumers, and customer surveys. See 37 C.F.R. §2.41(a)(3); TMEP §§1212.02(g), 
1212.06 et seq.
 
When determining whether the evidence shows the mark has acquired distinctiveness, the trademark 
examining attorney will consider the following six factors: (1) association of the mark with a particular 
source by actual purchasers (typically measured by customer surveys linking the name to the source); 
(2) length, degree, and exclusivity of use; (3) amount and manner of advertising; (4) amount of sales 
and number of customers; (5) intentional copying; and (6) unsolicited media coverage. See Converse, 
Inc. v. ITC, 909 F.3d 1110, 1120, 128 USPQ2d 1538, 1546 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (“the Converse factors”). 
“[N]o single factor is determinative.” In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d at 1300, 75 USPQ2d at 1424; 
see TMEP §§1212.06 et seq. Rather, all factors are weighed together in light of all the circumstances to 
determine whether the mark has acquired distinctiveness. In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d at 1300, 75 
USPQ2d at 1424. This evidence must demonstrate that the relevant public understands the primary 
significance of the mark as identifying the source of applicant’s product or service rather than 
identifying the product or service itself. In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d at 1297, 75 USPQ2d at 1422.
 
As well as submitting additional evidence, applicant may respond to the refusal by arguing in support 
of registration and/or amending the application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 
15 U.S.C. §1091(a); 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 2.75(a); TMEP §816. If applicant amends the application to the 
Supplemental Register, applicant is not precluded from submitting evidence and arguments against this 
refusal. TMEP §816.04.An applicant bears the burden of proving that a mark has acquired distinctiveness under Trademark Act 
Section 2(f). In re La. Fish Fry Prods., Ltd., 797 F.3d 1332, 1335, 116 USPQ2d 1262, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 
2015) (citing In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1422 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); 
TMEP §1212.01. “To show that a mark has acquired distinctiveness, an applicant must demonstrate 
that the relevant public understands the primary significance of the mark as identifying the source of a 
product or service rather than the product or service itself.” In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d at 1297, 
75 USPQ2d at 1422.
 
Allegations of sales and advertising expenditures do not per se establish that a term has acquired 
significance as a mark. See TMEP §1212.06(b). An applicant must also provide the actual advertising 
material so that the examining attorney may determine how the term is used, the commercial 
impression created by such use, and the significance the term would have to prospective purchasers. 
TMEP §1212.06(b); see In re Boston Beer Co., 198 F.3d 1370, 1373, 53 USPQ2d 1056, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 
1999); In re Packaging Specialists, Inc., 221 USPQ 917, 920 (TTAB 1984).
 
The ultimate test in determining acquisition of distinctiveness under Section 2(f) is not applicant’s 
efforts, but applicant’s success in educating the public to associate the claimed mark with a single 
source. In re LC Trademarks, Inc., 121 USPQ2d 1197, 1208 (TTAB 2016) (quoting Mini Melts, Inc. v. 
Reckitt Benckiser LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1464, 1480 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1212.06(b).
 
Currently, the record does not reflect that the applicant coined the term "Woodworking tools," that the 
applicant is the sole user of the term, that the applicant is the most visible user of ther term, and/or the 
nature of the remedy where the Office not only has allowed use of the term in identifications prior to 
the applicant's stated use, but also has deemed the term generic. See above. The record must clarify the 
issues raised herein to assert successfully a claim of acquired distinctiveness with respect to the term 
"WOODWORKING TOOLS" when used in connection with"dust removing installations for cleaning 
purposes; Dust separators; Dust exhausting installations for cleaning purposes" where the woodworking 
industry classifies such goods as "woodworking tools." Indeed, it is noted that the applicant has used 
"woodworking tools" generically in its prior Registration No. 5620098. See attached.

number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
