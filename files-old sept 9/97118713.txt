SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Applicant Must Disclaim the Wording "PICKLED PEPPERS"
•
Living Individual Inquiry
•
 
 
APPLICANT MUST DISCLAIM THE WORDING "PICKLED PEPPERS"
Applicant must disclaim the wording “PICKLED PEPPERS” because it is merely descriptive of an 
ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or 
services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
Here, applicant's identified goods are pickled peppers.  Thus, the wording "PICKLED PEPPERS" is 
merely descriptive of the goods.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “PICKLED PEPPERS” apart from the mark 
as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
 
LIVING INDIVIDUAL INQUIRY
Applicant must clarify whether the name "PETER" in the mark identifies a particular living individual. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§813, 1206.03. In this case, the application neither specifies whether 
the name in the mark identifies a particular living individual nor includes a written consent. See TMEP 
§§813.01(a)-(b), 1206.04(a), 1206.05.
 
To register a mark that consists of or comprises the name of a particular living individual, including a 
first name, pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, an applicant must provide a written consent 
personally signed by the named individual. 15 U.S.C. §1052(c); TMEP §§813, 1206.04(a).
 
Accordingly, if the name in the mark does not identify a particular living individual, applicant 
must submit a statement to that effect (e.g., “The name shown in the mark does not identify a particular 
living individual.”).
 
However, if the name in the mark does identify a particular living individual, applicant must 
submit both of the following:
 
(1)        The following statement: “The name(s) shown in the mark identifies a 
living individual(s) whose consent(s) to register is made of record.” If the name is a 
pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, applicant must provide the following statement: 
“PETER identifies <specify individual legal name>, a living individual whose consent is of 
record.”(2)        A written consent, personally signed by the named individual(s), as follows: 
“I, <specify legal name>, consent to the use and registration of my name, PETER, as a 
trademark and/or service mark with the USPTO.”
 
For an overview of the requirements for names appearing in marks, and instructions on how to satisfy 
this requirement using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see 
the Name/Portrait/Signature of Particular Living Individual in Mark webpage.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
 
Please email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status &

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
