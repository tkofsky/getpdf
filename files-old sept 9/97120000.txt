Issue date:  August 23, 2022

2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
•
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 2855971. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark, ATLAS WILD in standard characters for "On-line retail 
store services featuring supplements" in International Class 035. 
 
Registrant's mark is ATLAS NUTRITION in standard charactersfor "Nutritional Supplements" in 
International Class 005. 
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Applicant's mark is ATLAS WILD in standard characters; Registrant's mark is ATLAS NUTRITION 
in standard characters.  The marks create the same commercial impression because they contain the 
same dominant element, namely, ATLAS.
 
Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any trademark 
or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 
F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between VEUVE 
ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent 
feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate 
Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding 
similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because “consumers 
must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303,128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial words is 
particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”).  In the present case 
applicant's mark ATLAS WILD and the cited mark ATLAS NUTRITION both begin with the word 
ATLAS, making ATLAS the dominant portion of each mark, and leaving the remaining portion of each 
mark, namely, WILD and NUTRITION, as less significant.  
 
Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of 
terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See 
Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), 
aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 
1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH 
confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM 
and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-
(iii).  Here as in the cases above, the marks both contain the dominant term ATLAS which creates a 
similar overall commercial impression in each mark, making consumer confusion likely. 
 
Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or 
dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 
USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 
751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or 
generic for a party’s goods and/or services is typically less significant or less dominant when 
comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 
2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 
1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).  In the case of the cited mark, NUTRITION has been 
disclaimed as descriptive of registrant's goods, leaving ATLAS as the more dominant portion of the 
mark, as detailed above. 
 
Because the marks contain the same dominant element and thus create the same commercial 
impression, the marks are considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes. 
 
Relatedness of the Goods and Services
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark, ATLAS WILD in standard characters for "On-line retail 
store services featuring supplements" in International Class 035. 
 
Registrant's mark is ATLAS NUTRITION in standard characters for "Nutritional Supplements" in 
International Class 005. 
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screencaptures from the weblinks below, establishes thatthe same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant goods and/or services and 
markets the goods and/or services under the same mark.

https://www.walgreens.com/store/store/xpo_products.jsp?pluCode=2807 
 
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are considered related for likelihood of 
confusion purposes. See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); 
In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Further, the use of similar marks on or in connection with both products and retail-store services has 
been held likely to cause confusion where the evidence showed that the retail-store services featured 
the same type of products. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 
1051 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding the use of similar marks for various clothing items, including athletic 
uniforms, and for retail shops featuring sports team related clothing and apparel likely to cause 
confusion); In re Country Oven, Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 443903, at *12 (TTAB 2019) (holding the use of 
identical marks for bread buns and retail bakery stores and shops likely to cause confusion); In re 
House Beer, LLC, 114 USPQ2d 1073, 1078 (TTAB 2015) (holding the use of identical marks for beer 
and for retail store services featuring beer likely to cause confusion); TMEP §1207.01(a)(ii).
 
Accordingly, the goods and services are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of confusion 
analysis.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods and services are related, there is a likelihood of confusion 
as to the source of applicant's goods and services.  Therefore, applicant's mark is not entitled to 
registration.  
 
 Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.

number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
