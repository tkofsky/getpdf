SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Amended Identification of Goods Required
•
 
 
AMENDED IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS REQUIRED 
 
The wording "Control system for audio devices, namely, a control interface for controlling the position 
of potentiometers or switches on audio devices using expression pedals or footswitches" in 
International Class 9 is indefinite and must be clarified because the nature of the goods are not clear. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must further specify the nature of the goods.  
Where possible, applicant must amend the identification to specify the common commercial or generic 
name of the goods. See TMEP §1402.01. If the goods have no common commercial or generic name, 
applicant must describe the product, its main purpose, and its intended uses. See id.  Further, because 
applicant has identified its goods as being a type of '"system", applicant must clarify the goods by (1) 
describing the nature, purpose, or use of the system; and (2) listing the system’s parts or components, 
using common generic terms and referencing the primary parts or components of the system first. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. The system will be classified in the same international class as 
the primary parts or components of the system. TMEP §1401.05(d).   
 
Applicant has included the term “or” in the identification of goods.  However, this term is generally not 
accepted in identifications when (1) it is unclear whether applicant is using the mark, or intends to use 
the mark, on all the identified goods; (2) the nature of the goods is unclear; or (3) classification cannot 
be determined from such wording. See TMEP §1402.03(a). In this case, the nature of the goods are not 
clear because is it not clear if the control interface is for controlling the position of potentiometers, for 
controlling the position of switches, or both.  Similarly, it is not clear if the control interface is intended 
to be used with expression pedals, with footswitches, or both.
 
An application must specify, in an explicit manner, the particular goods or services on or in connection 
with which the applicant uses, or has a bona fide intention to use, the mark in commerce. See 15 U.S.C. 
§1051(a)(2), (b)(2); 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Therefore, applicant should replace “or” 
with “and” in the identification of goods, if appropriate, or rewrite the identification with the “or” 
deleted and the goods specified using definite and unambiguous language.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate (suggested language in bold):
 
International Class 9: Control system for audio devices comprised of an electronic control interface 
for controlling the position of potentiometers and switches on audio devices in the nature of {clarify 
nature of audio devices, e.g., guitar amplifiers} using expression pedals and footswitches 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods, but not to broaden or expand thegoods beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO

•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
