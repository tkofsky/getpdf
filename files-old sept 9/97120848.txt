NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date below or the application will be abandoned. 
Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this
Office action. 
 
 
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
 
 
This Office action is supplemental to and supersedes the previous Office action issued on 8/26/22 in connection with this application. The
assigned trademark examining attorney inadvertently omitted a requirement relevant to the mark in the subject application. See TMEP §§706,
711.02.  Specifically, it was overlooked that applicant submitted a voluntary disclaimer in the application.
 
Applicant must address all issue(s) raised in this Office action, in addition to the issues raised in the Office action dated 8/26/22, sent earlier in
the day. 
 
The following is a SUMMARY OF ISSUES that applicant must address:
 
            •   NEW ISSUE:  Disclaimer
            •   Section 2(d) refusal
            •  Drawing/specimen matching refusal
            •  Potential disclaimer required
 
 
Applicant must respond to all issues raised in this Office action and the previous Office action, within six (6) months of the date of issuance of
this Office action. 37 C.F.R. §2.62(a); see TMEP §711.02. If applicant does not respond within this time limit, the application will be
abandoned.  37 C.F.R. §2.65(a).VOLUNTARY DISCLAIMER – Advisory
 
Applicant has disclaimed the entire applied-for mark; however, an entire mark may not be disclaimed.  TMEP §1213.06; see 15 U.S.C. §1056(a);
In re Dena Corp. v. Belvedere Int’l Inc., 950 F.2d 1555, 1560, 21 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 1991); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d
1080, 1081 n.1 (TTAB 2001).  If the applied-for mark is not registrable as a whole, a disclaimer will not make it registrable.  TMEP §1213.06.  
Accordingly, the disclaimer of “CANNABUILD” is not accepted and will not be entered into the USPTO’s database.  See TMEP §714.05(a).

GENERAL GUIDANCE
·        Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid
missing critical deadlines.
 
·         Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO notices about your application.
 
·        Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that may try to take financial advantage of
you. Private companies may call you and pretend to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official
USPTO documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security number over the phone. And
all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed from the domain “@uspto.gov.”  Verify the correspondence originated
from us by using your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the “Documents”
tab, or contact
the Trademark Assistance Center. 
 
·        Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to have one under the trademark rules,
we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration
process. The USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but rather works for and
represents the USPTO in trademark matters.To:

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date below or the application will be abandoned. 
Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this
Office action. 
 
 
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
 
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant must respond timely and completely to
the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62, 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in U.S. Registration Nos. 5640449 and
5809895.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered mark that it is likely consumers would be
confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of
confusion is determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361,
177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “ du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747
(Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of
similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie
Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the
similarities between the compared marks and (2) the relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at
1322, 123 USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002));
Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated
by [Section] 2(d) goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and differences in the
marks.”); TMEP §1207.01. 
 
Comparison of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital
Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve
Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v). 
“Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks confusingly similar.”  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d
1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Applicant’s mark is CANNABUILD.   The registered mark is CANNATECH BUILDERS, in standard character form and stylized form.
 
The marks have similar commercial impressions since both start with “CANNA” and end with a form of the word “BUILD.”
 
It has been held that marks may be confusingly similar in appearance despite the addition, deletion, or substitution of letters or words. See, e.g.,
Weiss Assocs. Inc. v. HRL Assocs. Inc., 902 F.2d 1546, 14 USPQ2d 1840 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (finding TMM confusingly similar to TMS); Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 811 F.2d 1490, 1 USPQ2d 1813 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (affirming Board’s holding that source
confusion is likely where COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH are used in connection with identical banking services); Ava Enters. v. Audio
Boss USA, Inc., 77 USPQ2d 1783 (TTAB 2006) (finding AUDIO BSS USA and design similar in appearance to BOSS AUDIO SYSTEMS
(stylized)); In re Lamson Oil Co., 6 USPQ2d 1041 (TTAB 1987) (finding TRUCOOL and TURCOOL confusingly similar in appearance); In re
Pix of Am., Inc., 225 USPQ 691 (TTAB 1985) (finding NEWPORTS and NEWPORT to be essentially identical in appearance); In re Pellerin
Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558 (TTAB 1983) (finding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS (stylized) to be highly similar in appearance); In re BASF
A.G., 189 USPQ 424 (TTAB 1975) (finding difference between marks LUTEX and LUTEXAL insufficient to avoid source confusion).
 
Comparison of the Services/Trade Channels
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am.
Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898
(Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding their marketing are
such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v.
Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715,
1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Applicant indicates the following services:  “Construction of cannabis-related structures for businesses; Construction services, namely, planning,
laying out and custom construction of commercial buildings; Advisory services relating to the construction of buildings; Consultancy and
information services relating to construction; Consultancy relating to the construction of buildings; Consultancy services relating to the
construction of buildings.”
 
The services of the parties are highly related, if not identical.  Registrant provides “Building construction,” and “Planning and construction of
technical grow facilities.”  Both parties provide construction of buildings, and registrant’s “technical grow facilities” could be in the nature of
“cannabis-related structures for businesses,” as stated by applicant – that is, buildings for growing cannabis.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by submitting evidence and arguments in
support of registration.
 
If applicant chooses to respond to the refusal(s) to register, then applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
REFUSAL – MARK DIFFERS ON DRAWING & SPECIMEN
 
Mark shown on drawing does not match mark on specimen.  Registration is refused because the specimen does not show the mark in the
drawing in use in commerce, which is required in the application or amendment to allege use.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C.
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i).  The mark appearing on the specimen and in the
drawing must match; that is, the mark in the drawing “must be a substantially exact representation of the mark” on the specimen.   See 37 C.F.R.§2.51(a)-(b); TMEP §807.12(a). 
 
In this case, the specimen displays the mark as CANNA BUILD (as two words).  However, the drawing displays the mark as CANNABUILD (as
a unitary mark).  Applicant has thus failed to provide the required evidence of use of the mark in commerce.  See TMEP §807.12(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Submit a new drawing of the mark that shows the mark on the specimen and, if appropriate, an amendment of the description
and/or color claim that agrees with the new drawing.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b).  Applicant may amend the mark in the drawing
to match the mark on the specimen but may not make any other changes or amendments that would materially alter the drawing of
the mark.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b); TMEP §807.14.
 
(2)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen ) for each applicable international class that (a) shows the mark in
the drawing in actual use in commerce for the goods and/or services in the application or amendment to allege use, and (b) was in
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of an amendment to allege use.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual
container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly
associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display
associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include
information necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include:  (1) copies of advertising
and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale,
rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or
printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20
or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
For more information about drawings and instructions on how to satisfy these response options using the online Trademark Electronic
Application System (TEAS) form, see the Drawing webpage. 
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED – if mark is amended to “CANNA BUILD”
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “BUILD” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature,
purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or services. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695
F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The word “BUILD” merely indicates the purpose of applicant’s services – to build cannabis-related structures for businesses.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “BUILD” apart from the mark as shown.  
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS), see the
Disclaimer webpage.
