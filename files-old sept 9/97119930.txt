SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Identification of Goods Requires Amendment
•
Partial-Abandonment Advisory
•
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS REQUIRES AMENDMENT 
 
Class 11
 
Particular wording in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified.  Specifically, the 
entry "Component parts specially adapted for nuclear reactors" is indefinite because it does not 
precisely set forth the common name of the components and does not indicate the component parts are 
sold as a component of another finished product.  When a mark is used to identify only a component of a 
product, and not the entire product, the identification must (1) precisely set forth the common name of the component 
or ingredient, (2) indicate that the component or ingredient is sold as a component or ingredient of another finished 
product, and (3) set forth the common name of the finished product of which the identified component or ingredient 
forms a part.  See TMEP §1402.05(a).  This entry requires amendment to specify the generic or common commercial 
name of the components and indicate the components are sold as a component of the finished product (i.e., nuclear 
reactors).  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.  
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:
 
Class 11: Energy generation power plants; Energy storage plants; Nuclear reactors; Component parts in 
the nature of [specify generic name, e.g., steam valves] specially adapted for and sold as a 
component of nuclear reactors.
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e). 7
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
PARTIAL-ABANDONMENT ADVISORY 
 
If applicant does not respond to this Office action within the six-month period for response, the 
following goods in International Class 11 will be deleted from the application:Class 11: Component parts specially adapted for nuclear reactors
 
The application will then proceed with the following goods in International Class 11 only:
 
Class 11: Energy generation power plants; Energy storage plants; Nuclear reactors. 
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.65(a)-(a)(1); TMEP §718.02(a).

informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191;

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119930
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
