NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF OFFICE’S DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the Office’s database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
REQUIREMENT - MARK DESCRIPTION
•
REQUIREMENT - DISCLAIMER
•
 
REQUIREMENT - MARK DESCRIPTION 
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one is incomplete and 
does not describe all the significant aspects of the mark, in particular, the arrangement of the double 
"C" letter combination. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. Descriptions must be accurate 
and identify all the literal and design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §2.37; TMEP §§808 et seq.
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate: The mark consists of the stylized lettering "CC" 
where the letters are joined by the design of a horizontally positioned electrical cable with plugs 
on each end and the second letter "C" contains a gap through which the electrical cable extends. 
Underneath the "CC" lettering is the stylized wording "COMPANY CONNECT" with the word 
"THE" appearing above the word "COMPANY" and to the left of the "CC" letters.
 
REQUIREMENT - DISCLAIMER 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “COMPANY” because it is merely descriptive of a feature of 
applicant’s services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, 
Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from The American Heritage Dictioanr shows this wording means "a business 
enterprise." Wording that describes an intended user or group of users of a product or service is merely 
descriptive. E.g., In re Planalytics, Inc., 70 USPQ2d 1453 (TTAB 2004) (holding GASBUYER merely 
descriptive of intended user of risk management services in the field of pricing and purchasing natural 
gas); In re Camel Mfg. Co., 222 USPQ 1031 (TTAB 1984) (holding MOUNTAIN CAMPER merely 
descriptive of intended users of retail and mail order services in the field of outdoor equipment and 
apparel); see TMEP §1209.03(i). The applied-for services are "credit counseling services" and thus, the 
wording merely describes that applicant’s  services are intended to be used by business enterprises.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “COMPANY” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Response guidelines.  For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusaland/or requirement in this Office action.  For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above.  For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements.  Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
If applicant has questions regarding this Office action, please telephone or e-mail the assigned 
trademark examining attorney.  All relevant e-mail communications will be placed in the official 
application record; however, an e-mail communication will not be accepted as a response to this Office 
action and will not extend the deadline for filing a proper response.  See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.  Further, although the trademark examining attorney may provide 
additional explanation pertaining to the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action, the 
trademark examining attorney may not provide legal advice or statements about applicant’s rights.  See 
TMEP §§705.02, 709.06.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120470
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
