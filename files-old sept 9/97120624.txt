NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:Sections 1 and 45 Refusal - Unacceptable Specimen (Limited to Class 9 only);  
•
Requirement - Identification of Goods and Services. 
•
 
SEARCH OF USPTO’S DATABASE OF MARKS; NO CONFLICTING MARK(S) FOUND
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO’s database of registered and pending 
marks and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 
2(d).  TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  However, applicant must respond to the refusal(s) and 
requirement(s) set forth below.
 
SECTIONS 1 AND 45 REFUSAL - UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMEN
THIS PARTIAL REFUSAL APPLIES TO INTERNATIONAL CLASS 9 ONLY
 
Specimen is not an acceptable display for software. Registration is refused because the specimen in 
International Class 9 is not acceptable as a display associated with downloadable software and does not 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (b)(1); TMEP §§904, 904.03(e), (g), 904.07(a). An 
application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for 
mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a).
 
A display specimen for downloadable software (1) must show use of the mark directly associated with 
the goods and (2) such use must be of a point-of-sale nature. 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1). To show use of a 
point-of-sale nature, a specimen generally must provide sufficient information to enable the user to 
download or purchase the software from a website. See TMEP §904.03(e) (citing In re Azteca Sys., 
Inc., 102 USPQ2d 1955, 1957 (TTAB 2012)).
 
In this case, the specimen does not provide the means to enable the user to download or purchase the 
software from the website. See In re Sones, 590 F.3d 1282, 1286-89, 93 USPQ2d 1118, 1122-24 (Fed. 
Cir. 2009); In re Azteca Sys., Inc., 102 USPQ2d at 1957; TMEP §904.03(e), (i).  Accordingly, such 
material is mere advertising, which is not acceptable as a specimen for goods. See In re Yarnell Ice 
Cream, LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 265039, at *15-16 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re Siny Corp., 920 F.3d 1331, 
1336, 2019 USPQ2d 127099, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. 2019)); see also Avakoff v. S. Pac. Co., 765 F.2d 1097, 
1098, 226 USPQ 435, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §904.04(b), (c).
 
Examples of specimens. Specimens for downloadable software include instruction manuals or screen 
printouts from (1) webpages showing (a) the mark associated with the software and (b) ordering or 
purchasing information or information sufficient to download the software, (2) the actual program 
while running that shows the mark in the title bar, or (3) launch screens that show the mark in an 
introductory message box that appears after opening the program. See TMEP §904.03(e), (i), (j). Any 
webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date 
it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or 
in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the software identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
Additionally, applicant may respond to the stated refusal by submitting evidence and arguments against 
the refusal.  In addition, applicant may respond by doing one of the following:
 
(1)  Deleting the class to which the refusal pertains;
 
(2)  Filing a Request to Divide Application form (form #3) to divide out the goods and/or 
services that have not been refused registration, so that the mark may proceed toward publication 
for opposition in the classes to which the refusal does not pertain.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.87.  See 
generally TMEP §§1110 et seq. (regarding the requirements for filing a request to divide).  If 
applicant files a request to divide, then to avoid abandonment, applicant must also file a timely 
response to all outstanding issues in this Office action, including the refusal.  37 C.F.R. §2.87(e)
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
REQUIREMENT – IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES
 
The goods in International Class 9 are acceptable as written.  The services in International Class 
36 and International Class 42 are also acceptable as written.  Similarly, the wording "providing an 
online marketplace which connects sellers and buyers via an online platform for the wholesale 
remarketing and sale of motor vehicles" in International Class 35 is acceptable.  
 
However, the remaining wording in International Class 35 must be clarified.  Specifically, applicant has 
classified "providing business services, namely, preparing motor vehicle inspection reports for 
remarketed motor vehicles" in Class 35; however, it appears that the proper classification of 
the services is Class 42 as these services are closely related to motor vehicle inspections, a Class 42 
service.  Therefore, applicant may respond by (1) reclassifying these services in the proper international 
class, or (2) deleting “providing business services, namely, preparing motor vehicle inspection reports 
for remarketed motor vehicles” from the application.  See 37 C.F.R. §§2.86(a), 6.1; TMEP §§1403.02 
et seq. 
 
The wording "providing web-based transportation services for transporting and tracking of goods, 
namely, motor vehicles" in indefinite and needs to be clarified because the exact nature of "web-basedtransportation services" is unclear.  Additionally, this wording is too broad and could include services 
in other international classes. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.  For example, this 
wording could encompass web-based transportation management logistics services to facilitate 
transporting and tracking of motor vehicles in Class 35 and providing a website featuring online non-
downloadable software that enables users to arrange transport and tracking of motor vehicles in Class 
42.    
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate [changes are shown in bold typeface]: 
 
CLASS 9 – “Providing a downloadable mobile application which connects sellers and buyers of motor 
vehicles facilitating the sale of motor vehicles;”
 
CLASS 35 – “Providing an online marketplace which connects sellers and buyers via an online 
platform for the wholesale re-marketing and sale of motor vehicles; Providing web-based transportation 
services for transporting motor vehicles, namely, providing web-based transportation management 
logistics services to facilitate transporting and tracking of motor vehicles;”
 
CLASS 36 – “Financial services, namely, automotive dealer financing;” and
 
CLASS 42 – “Providing temporary use of online non-downloadable software which connects sellers 
and buyers via an online platform for the wholesale re-marketing and sale of motor vehicles; Motor 
vehicle inspection services, namely, preparing motor vehicle inspection reports for re-marketed motor 
vehicles; Providing web-based transportation services, namely, providing a website featuring online 
non-downloadable software that enables users to arrange transport and tracking of motor vehicles.”
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and services, but not to broaden or 
expand the goods and services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended.  See 
37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06.  Generally, any deleted goods and services may not later be 
reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
PARTIAL ABANDONMENT ADVISORY  
 
If applicant does not respond to this Office action within the six-month period for response, the 
following goods and services will be deleted from the application:
 
CLASS 9 - "Providing a downloadable mobile application which connects sellers and buyers of motor 
vehicles facilitating the sale of motor vehicles;" and 
 
CLASS 35 - "Providing business services, namely, preparing motor vehicle inspection reports for 
remarketed motor vehicles; Providing web-based transportation services for transporting and tracking 
of goods, namely, motor vehicles." 
 
The application will then proceed with the following services only:
 
CLASS 35 – “Providing an online marketplace which connects sellers and buyers via an onlineplatform for the wholesale re-marketing and sale of motor vehicles;”
 
CLASS 36 – “Financial services, namely, automotive dealer financing;” and
 
CLASS 42 – “Providing temporary use of online non-downloadable software which connects sellers 
and buyers via an online platform for the wholesale re-marketing and sale of motor vehicles.”
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.65(a)-(a)(1); TMEP §718.02(a).

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
