NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Section 2(d) Refusal-Likelihood of Confusion
•
Prior-Pending Application 
•
Identification of Goods and Services
•
Particular Services Exceed Scope of Foreign Registration- Section 1 and 44 Dual Basis -
International Class 44 
•
 
Section 2(d) Refusal-Likelihood of Confusion
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration No. 3384798, 5051182, and 6255834 .  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”).  In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.”  In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis:  (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services.  See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01. 
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or 
services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer.  See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  
Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the 
registrant.  TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
In the present case, the applicant's mark is CERA, in standard characters, for "Pharmaceuticals, medical 
and veterinary preparations; sanitary preparations for medical purposes; dietetic food and substances 
adapted for medical or veterinary use, food for babies; dietary supplements for human beings and 
animals; plasters, materials for dressings; material for stopping teeth, dental wax; disinfectants; 
preparations for destroying vermin; fungicides, herbicides; medical preparations; medical preparations 
for care workers; pharmaceutical preparations for medical purposes; medical dressings; medical 
plasters; incontinence garments; incontinence pads; medicated and sanitising soaps and detergents; 
disinfectants; antiseptics; pharmaceutical preparations for medical purposes for care workers; 
pharmaceutical preparations for care workers" in International Class 005 and "Medical services; 
veterinary services; hygienic and beauty care for human beings or animals; agriculture, aquaculture, 
horticulture and forestry services; medical care; medical assistance; medical nursing; medical care 
services; medical nursing services; medical house call services; arranging of medical treatment; 
arranging medical prescription services; arranging medical prescription services for home-visit nursing 
care; health care; health-care services; managed health care services; nursing home services; nursing 
care services; home-visit nursing care; providing information relating to nursing care services; respite 
care services in the nature of nursing aid services; home nursing aid services; advice relating to the 
personal welfare of elderly people (health); advice relating to the medical needs of elderly people; 
provision of domiciliary care services; provision of carer services and nursing services; palliative care; 
dementia care; post discharge care; respite care (provision of); gardening; care of pet animals; 
providing online information about the aforesaid services; information, consultancy and advisory 
services related to the aforesaid" in International Class 044. 
 
The registered marks are:
 
CERA VACX (Registration No. 3384798) in standard characters, used in connection with "food 
supplement containing rice syrup solids, sodium bicarbonate, and trisodium citrate" in International 
Class 005. 
 
CERA PRODUCTS (Registration No. 6255834) in standard characters, used in connection with "food 
supplement containing rice syrup solids, trisodium citrate dihydrate, sodium chloride, potassiumchloride" in International Class 005.
 
CERA-Q (Registration No. 5051182) in standard characters, used in connection with "dietary 
supplements" in International Class 005. 
 
Registration No. 3384798 and 6255835 are owned by the same entity. 
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant: similarity of the marks, similarity of the goods 
and services, and similarity of trade channels of the goods and services.  See In re Opus One, Inc., 60 
USPQ2d 1812 (TTAB 2001); In re Dakin’s Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d 1593 (TTAB 1999); In re 
Azteca Rest. Enters., Inc., 50 USPQ2d 1209 (TTAB 1999); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. 
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
The applicant's mark is similar to the registered marks because they all contain the identical dominant 
first term CERA, making the marks similar in sound, appearance, and commercial 
impression. Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any 
trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 
1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between 
VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a 
‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 
Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) 
(finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because 
“consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial 
words is particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”).  
 
Although the registered marks all contain additional terms in addition to the dominant first term CERA 
and the applied-for mark does not contain additional wording, consumers encountering the marks in 
relation to the goods and services would reasonably believe that the goods and services emanate from 
the same common source because they contain the identical first term CERA. The applicant merely 
deletes the terms "VACX", "PRODUCTS", and "-Q" from the applied-for mark. Moreoveer, the term 
PRODUCTS in Registration No. 6255834 is descriptive of the registrant's goods. Although marks are 
compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in creating a 
commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. 
Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or generic for a party’s goods and/or 
services is typically less significant or less dominant when comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 
903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 
F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).Although applicant's mark does not contain the entirety of the registered marks, applicant's mark is 
likely to appear to prospective purchasers as a shortened form of the registrants' marks. See In re 
Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting United States 
Shoe Corp., 229 USPQ 707, 709 (TTAB 1985)). Thus, merely omitting some of the wording from a 
registered mark may not overcome a likelihood of confusion. See In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 
1342, 94 USPQ2d 1257; In re Optica Int’l, 196 USPQ 775, 778 (TTAB 1977); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-
(iii). In this case, applicant’s mark does not create a distinct commercial impression from the registered 
marks because it contains the identical term CERA in the registered marks and does not add any 
wording that would distinguish it from the registered marks.  
 
For the reasons discussed above, the applicant's mark is confusingly similar to the registered marks.  
 
Relatedness of the Goods/Services
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The applicant's goods are "Pharmaceuticals, medical and veterinary preparations; sanitary preparations 
for medical purposes; dietetic food and substances adapted for medical or veterinary use, food for 
babies; dietary supplements for human beings and animals; plasters, materials for dressings; material 
for stopping teeth, dental wax; disinfectants; preparations for destroying vermin; fungicides, herbicides; 
medical preparations; medical preparations for care workers; pharmaceutical preparations for medical 
purposes; medical dressings; medical plasters; incontinence garments; incontinence pads; medicated 
and sanitising soaps and detergents; disinfectants; antiseptics; pharmaceutical preparations for medical 
purposes for care workers; pharmaceutical preparations for care workers" in International Class 005. 
 
The goods in Registration No.  3384798 are "food supplement containing rice syrup solids, sodium 
bicarbonate, and trisodium citrate" in International Class 005. 
 
The goods in Registration No. 6255834 are "food supplement containing rice syrup solids, trisodium 
citrate dihydrate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride" in International Class 005.
 
The goods in Registration No. 5051182are "dietary supplements" in International Class 005. 
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods stated in the application 
and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 
F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the application uses broad wording to describe "dietetic food and substances adapted for 
medical or veterinary use, food for babies; dietary supplements for human beings and animals", which 
presumably encompasses all goods of the type described, including registrant’s more narrow "food 
supplement containing rice syrup solids, sodium bicarbonate, and trisodium citrate" (Registration No. 
3384798); "food supplement containing rice syrup solids, trisodium citrate dihydrate, sodium chloride, 
potassium chloride" (Registration No. 62558340). In addition, the "dietary supplements" in Registration 
No. 5051182 encompass the applicant's more narrow ""dietetic food and substances adapted for 
medical or veterinary use, food for babies; dietary supplements for human beings and animals". See, 
e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. 
Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are 
legally identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing 
Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 
(C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball 
Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods  of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods  are related.
 
In addition, the attached Internet evidence, consisting of third-party websites, establishes that the same 
entity commonly manufactures, produces, and provides the relevant goods and services and markets the 
goods and services under the same mark.  Applicant's and registrants' goods and services are likely to 
be encountered together in the marketplace by consumers and consumers would mistakenly believe that 
the goods and services originate from a common source.  Thus, the goods and services are considered 
related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 
1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 
2009).
 
As discussed above, the applicant's mark is similar to the registered marks, and the goods and services 
are related. Accordingly, there would be a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the goods and 
services.  Registration of the mark is therefore refused under Trademark Act Section 2(d).
 
Although applicant's mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusals by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirements set forth below.
 
Prior-Pending Application  
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 79304410 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
While no response is required for the above issue at this time, the applicant must respond to the 
following:
 
Identification of Goods and Services
 
The wording “Pharmaceuticals, medical and veterinary preparations”, "dietetic food and substances 
adapted for medical or veterinary use, food for babies", "plasters, materials for dressings", "medical 
preparations", "medical preparations for care workers", "pharmaceutical preparations for medical 
purposes", "pharmaceuticals preparations for medical purposes for care workers", and "pharmaceutical 
preparations for care workers" in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified because 
it does not specify the nature of the goods. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.
 
In addition, applicant is advised to delete or modify the duplicate entry in the identification of goods in 
International Class 005 for “disinfectants." See generally TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.01(a). If applicant 
does not respond to this issue, be advised that the USPTO will remove duplicate entries from the 
identification prior to registration.  
 
The wording “agriculture, aquaculture, horticulture and forestry services”, "arranging of medical 
treatment", arranging medical prescription services", arranging medical prescription services for home-
visit nursing care", "advice relating to the personal welfare of elderly people (health)", "advice relating 
to the medical needs of elderly people", "provision of domiciliary care services", "provision of carer 
services and nursing services", "dementia care", "post discharge care", "respite care (provision of)", and 
"care of pet animals" in the identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because it does 
not specify the nature of the services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. 
 
In addition, the identification of goods and/or services contains parentheses. Generally, an applicant 
should not use parentheses and brackets, including curly brackets, in identifications in order to avoid 
confusion with the USPTO’s practice of using parentheses and brackets in registrations to indicate (1) 
goods and/or services that have been deleted from registrations, (2) goods and/or services not claimed 
in an affidavit of incontestability, or (3) guidance to users of the USPTO’s U.S. Acceptable 
Identification of Goods and Services Manual to draft an acceptable identification. See TMEP 
§§1402.04, 1402.12. The only exception for including parenthetical information in identifications is if 
it serves to explain or translate the matter immediately preceding the parenthetical phrase in such a way 
that it does not affect the clarity or scope of the identification, e.g., “fried tofu pieces (abura-age).” See 
TMEP §1402.12.
 
Therefore, applicant must remove the parentheses from the identification and incorporate any 
parenthetical or bracketed information into the description of the goods and/or services.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to the following, if accurate:
 
International Class 005
 
Pharmaceuticals preparations, namely, {indicate specific pharmaceutical preparations, e.g. allergymedications, hemostatic preparations, hair growth stimulatnts, etc.}, medical preparations 
namely, {indicate specific medical preparations, e.g. foot, hand, and skin creams for diabetics,

Scope Advisory 
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the U.S. application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found in or encompassed by those in the original U.S. 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by theordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e). Additionally, for U.S. 
applications filed under Trademark Act Section 44(e), the scope of the identification for purposes of 
permissible amendments may not exceed the scope of the goods and/or services identified in the 
foreign registration.  37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); Marmark, Ltd. v. Nutrexpa, S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845 
(TTAB 1989) (citing In re Löwenbräu München, 175 USPQ 178, 181 (TTAB 1972)); TMEP §§1012, 
1402.01(b). 
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the 
USPTO’s 
online 
searchable U.S. Acceptable 
Identification 
of 
Goods 
and 
Services Manual. See TMEP §1402.04. 
 
Particular Services Exceed Scope of Foreign Registration- Section 1 and 44 Dual Basis -
International Class 44
 
Particular wording in the U.S. application's identification of  services has been found to exceed the 
scope of services in the foreign registration upon which the U.S. application relies for a Section 44(e) 
filing basis. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. For a U.S. application based 
on Trademark Act Section 44(e), an applicant is required to list only goods and/or services that are 
within the scope of the goods and/or services in the foreign registration. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§§1012, 1402.01(b). Therefore, this wording is not considered part of the identification of goods and/or 
services in the U.S. application for the Section 44(e) filing basis, and only the remaining wording in the 
identification is operative for purposes of future amendment for that basis. See TMEP §1402.01(b); cf. 
TMEP §1402.07(d). 
 
In this case, the U.S. application identifies the particular services as follows: “medical services”, 
"veterinary services", "hygienic and beauty care for human beings or animals; agriculture, aquaculture, 
horticulture and forestry services; medical care; medical assistance; medical nursing; medical care 
services; medical nursing services; medical house call services; arranging of medical treatment; 
arranging medical prescription services; arranging medical prescription services for home-visit nursing 
care; health care; health-care services; managed health care services", "nursing care services", and 
"providing information relating to nursing care services".  
 
However, the foreign registration identifies the following services: “home health care services; home 
nursing aid services; home health care services, home nursing aid services; advice relating to the 
personal welfare of elderly people; advice relating to the medical needs of elderly people; provision of 
domiciliary care services; provision of carer services and nursing services; palliative care; dementia 
care; post discharge care; respite care; gardening; care of pet animals; providing online information 
about the aforesaid; information, consultancy and advisory services related to the aforesaid".  
 
These goods and/or services in the U.S. application exceed the scope of  services in the foreign 
registration because the U.S. application includes broad wording to identify the services and the 
services in the foreign registration are limited in nature. Thus, the services in the U.S. application are 
not acceptable for the Section 44(e) filing basis.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by satisfying one of the following:
(1)               Limiting the identification of services in the U.S. application to correspond to the 
services in the foreign registration and not exceeding the scope of the initial oracceptably amended identification in the U.S. application, and/or deleting from the U.S. 
application all goods and/or services beyond the scope of the foreign registration; or
(2)               Deleting the Section 44 basis for the  services beyond the scope of the foreign 
registration and relying solely on the Section 1 basis for those goods and/or services.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(a)-(b), 1126; 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(6), 2.34(b), 2.35(b); Marmark Ltd. v. Nutrexpa 
S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845 (TTAB 1989); TMEP §§806.02, 806.04, 1402.01(b).
 
Additionally, applicant may respond by arguing that these services are within the scope of the foreign 
registration and should remain in the U.S. application.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119034
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
