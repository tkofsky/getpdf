NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. 
 Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.I.         SEARCH OF THE OFFICE RECORDS
 
No Prior Conflicting Marks
The examining attorney has searched the Office records and has found no similar registered or pending 
mark which would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  TMEP 
§704.02.
 
II.        INFORMALITIES
 
Although there is no conflict with any prior registered or pending marks, the applicant must respond to 
the following issue(s). 
 
Application Refused—Section 1(a)--Specimen Does Not Indicate Use in Relation to the Identified 
Goods
An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for 
mark in use in commerce for each international class of goods and/or services identified in the 
application or amendment to allege use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); 
TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).  The current specimen(s) do not demonstrate proper use of the proposed mark 
in relation to the goods specified in the application. 
 
Section 45 of the Trademark Act requires use of the mark “on the goods, their containers or the 
displays associated therewith, or on the tags or labels affixed thereto”. 15 U.S.C. §1127; TMEP 
§§901.01, 904.03.  Material that functions merely to tell the prospective purchaser about the goods, or 
to promote the sale of the goods, is not acceptable to support trademark use. Similarly, leaflets, 
handbills, brochures, advertising circulars and other printed advertising material or informational 
inserts are generally not acceptable to show trademark use. In re MediaShare Corp., 43 USPQ2d 1304 
(TTAB 1997); In re Schiapparelli Searle, 26 USPQ2d 1520 (TTAB 1993); In re Drilco Industrial Inc., 
15 USPQ2d 1671 (TTAB 1990); In re ITT Rayonier Inc., 208 USPQ 86 (TTAB 1980); In re Bright of 
America, Inc., 205 USPQ 63 (TTAB 1979); TMEP 904.04(b).  However, an instruction sheet may be 
an acceptable specimen. In re Ultraflight Inc., 221 USPQ 903 (TTAB 1984); TMEP §§904.04(b), (c), 
1301.04.
 
In this case, the specimen consists of a partial copy of the applicant's webpage and a business card. 
 Although the proposed mark is displayed on the specimen, the specimen is not acceptable to 
demonstrate use of the proposed mark with the goods listed in the application.  Neither specimen shows 
the proposed mark used as a label for, or indicator of source of, the proposed goods.  TMEP §§904.03, 
904.04(b)-(c).  
 
With respect to the webpage, the current specimen is deficient because it does not show a means for 
ordering the identified goods.  A webpage or catalog display specimen (1) must show use of the mark 
directly associated with the goods and (2) such use must be of a point-of-sale nature. 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(1). This means that this type of display specimen must include the following:
 
(1)        A picture or sufficient textual description of the goods;
 
(2)        The mark associated with the goods; and
 
(3)        A means for ordering the goods such as a “shopping cart” button/link, an 
order form, or a telephone number for placing orders.See In re Sones, 590 F.3d 1282, 1286-89, 93 USPQ2d 1118, 1122-24 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re Azteca 
Sys., Inc., 102 USPQ2d 1955, 1957-58 (TTAB 2012); In re Dell Inc., 71 USPQ2d 1725, 1727 (TTAB 
2004); Lands’ End v. Manbeck, 797 F. Supp. 511, 514, 24 USPQ2d 1314, 1316 (E.D. Va. 1992); 
TMEP §904.03(h), (i)-.03(i)(D).
 
In this case, the webpage specimen does not show sufficient means for ordering the goods. Specifically, 
there is no "buy now" button or order form for the goods.  Accordingly, the submitted webpage 
specimen is deemed to be mere advertising, which is not acceptable as a specimen for goods. See In re 
Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 265039, at *15-16 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re Siny Corp., 
920 F.3d 1331, 1336, 2019 USPQ2d 127099, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. 2019)); see also Avakoff v. S. Pac. Co., 
765 F.2d 1097, 1098, 226 USPQ 435, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §904.04(b), (c).
 
With respect to the business card, not only is there no ordering information on the card fpr the eye 
prosthetic, but it seems to indicate that the proposed mark and person named on the card is providing 
ocularist/prosthetic eye fitting services, not producing the underlying good--the occular prosthetic that 
is to be fitted.  Accordingly, registration is refused because the specimens do not show the applied-for 
mark in use in commerce in connection with any of the goods specified in the application or 
amendment to allege use.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Graystone Consulting Assocs., Inc., 115 USPQ2d 2035, 2037-38 
(TTAB 2015); In re Chengdu AOBI Info. Tech. Co., 111 USPQ2d 2080, 2081-82 (TTAB 2011); TMEP 
§§904, 904.07(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)             Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of an 
amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the goods and/or 
services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified substitute 
specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in a signed 
affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or new, or 
originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as 
the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.”  The 
substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods 
bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; 
or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  Leaflets, handbills, advertising circulars, and other 
advertising materials are generally not acceptable specimens for goods.  See TMEP §§904.03 et 
seq.  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark 
in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c).  Please 
Note:  Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed.  37 C.F.R. §2.56(c).  
 
(2)       Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing an 
amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before publication.  Thisoption will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.  
 
Applicant’s Response 
There is no required format or form for responding to an Office action.  For this application to proceed 
further, the applicant must explicitly address each refusal and/or requirement raised in this Office 
action.  If the action includes a refusal, the applicant may provide arguments and/or evidence as to why 
the refusal should be withdrawn and the mark should register. The applicant may also have other 
options specified in this Office action for responding to a refusal and should consider those options 
carefully. To respond to requirements and certain refusal response options, the applicant should set 
forth in writing the required changes or statements.  For more information and general tips on 
responding to USPTO Office actions, response options, and how to file a response online, please see 
“Responding to Office Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” on the 
USPTO's website. 
 
If the applicant does not respond to this Office action within six months of the issue/mailing date, or 
responds by expressly abandoning the application, the application process will end and the trademark 
will fail to register.  See 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.65(a), 2.68(a); TMEP §§718.01, 718.02. 
 Additionally, the USPTO will not refund the application filing fee, which is a required processing fee. 
 See 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(1)(i)-(iv), 2.209(a); TMEP §405.04.  When an application has abandoned for 
failure to respond to an Office action, an applicant may timely file a petition to revive the application, 
which, if granted, would allow the application to return to active status.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.66; TMEP 
§1714.  The petition must be filed within two months of the date of issuance of the notice of 
abandonment and may be filed online via the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS).  See 
37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(15)(ii), 2.66(a)(1), (b)(1)
 
Responses to Office actions must be properly signed.  See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(b), 2.193(e)(2); TMEP 
§§712, 712.01.  If an applicant is not represented by a U.S.-licensed attorney, the response must be 
signed by the individual applicant or someone with legal authority to bind a juristic applicant (e.g., a 
corporate officer or general partner).  See 37 C.F.R. §2.193(e)(2)(ii); TMEP §§611.03(b), 611.06(b)-
(h), 712.01.  In the case of joint applicants, all must sign.  37 C.F.R. §2.193(e)(2)(ii); TMEP 
§611.06(a).
 
If an applicant is represented by a U.S.-licensed attorney authorized to practice before the USPTO, the 
attorney must sign the response. 37 C.F.R. §2.193(e)(2)(i); TMEP §712.01. The only attorneys who 
may sign responses are (1) attorneys in good standing with a bar of the highest court of any U.S. state 
or territory, or (2) Canadian trademark attorneys or agents reciprocally recognized by the USPTO’s 
Office of Enrollment and Discipline (OED) to represent applicants located in Canada and who are 
working under a qualified U.S.-licensed attorney. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.17(a), 11.14(a), (c), (e); TMEP 
§602. Foreign attorneys, other than recognized Canadian trademark attorneys or agents, do not have 
authority to sign responses. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.17(e), 11.14(c)(1), (e); TMEP §602.03-.03(a). If an 
applicant is initially represented by an attorney, and then later retains another U.S.-licensed attorney 
from a different firm, the newly retained attorney may not sign responses until the applicant files a new 
power and/or revocation of attorney. See 37 C.F.R. §2.18(a)(7); TMEP §604.03. Please Note: In all 
cases, the signer must be identified by first and last name and title or position. 37 C.F.R. §2.193(d).If the applicant has technical questions about the TEAS response to Office action form, applicant can 
review the electronic filing tips available online at http://www.uspto.gov/teas/eFilingTips.htm and 
email technical questions to TEAS@uspto.gov.
 
If the applicant or its appointed attorney has any questions or needs assistance in responding to this 
Office action, please telephone the assigned examining attorney.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120517
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the

After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
