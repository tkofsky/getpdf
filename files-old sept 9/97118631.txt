The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Officeaction.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues
 
Section 2(d) - PARTIAL Likelihood of Confusion Refusal
•
 
Section 2(d) - PARTIAL Likelihood of Confusion Refusal 
 
Note: This refusal only applies to some of applicant's goods, namely, "Bicycles; Air pumps for bicycles; 
Bicycle motors; Bicycle pedals; Bicycle saddle covers; Bicycle stands; Bicycle tires; Electric bicycles; 
Frames for bicycles; Motorized bicycles."
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 5432761. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark "ZTYGY" in standard characters for “Bicycles; Air pumps 
for bicycles; Bicycle motors; Bicycle pedals; Bicycle saddle covers; Bicycle stands; Bicycle tires; 
Electric bicycles; Frames for bicycles; Mobility scooters; Motorized bicycles; Self-balancing scooters; 
Vehicle parts, namely, shock absorbers” in International Class 12.Registrant’s mark is "ZTYGY" in standard characters for “Animal-activated pet feeders that include 
dispensers for releasing pet toy feeder balls with pet food and pet treats therein; Automated pet 
appliances, namely, litter boxes; Brushes for pets; Cages for household pets; Cages for pets; Cosmetic 
brushes; Drinking bottles for sports; Drinking flasks; Electric pet brushes; Feeding vessels for pets; Fly 
catchers; Fly swatters; Grooming tools for pets, namely, combs and brushes; Hand-operated devices for 
scratching pets; Household storage containers for pet food; Incense burners; Insect traps; Litter boxes 
for pets; Mouse traps; Non-mechanized pet waterers in the nature of portable water and fluid dispensers 
for pets; Pet brushes; Pet feeding dishes; Pet feeding and drinking bowls; Pet grooming device 
comprising a built in brush head and an attachment that connects to vacuums; Pet grooming device 
comprising a built in brush head and an attachment that connects to a water source; Pet grooming 
device comprising a sprayer nozzle and an attachment that connects to a water source and to a reservoir 
for a conditioning agent; Pet litter box liners; Pet litter boxes; Pet treat jars; Pet waste management kits 
comprising scoops for pet waste disposal, plastic bags and liners, and portable dispensers for plastic 
bags and liners sold as a unit; Plug-in diffusers for mosquito repellents; Racks and stands for elevating 
pet feeding bowls and dishes; Rat traps; Scoops for the disposal of pet waste; Toothbrushes for pets” in 
International Class 21. 
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
In a likelihood of confusion determination, the marks in their entireties are compared for similarities in 
appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression. In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 
1323, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1748 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 
746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve 
Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 
2005)); In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 
1973); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v).
 
In the present case, applicant’s mark is "ZTYGY" and registrant’s mark is "ZTYGY". These marks are 
identical in appearance, sound, and meaning, “and have the potential to be used . . . in exactly the same 
manner.” In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), aff’d, 866 F.3d 1315, 123 
USPQ2d 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Additionally, because they are identical, these marks are likely to 
engender the same connotation and overall commercial impression when considered in connection with 
applicant’s and registrant’s respective goods and/or services. Id.
 
Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar.
 
Relatedness of the Goods and/or Services 
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Here, applicant’s goods and/or services, “Bicycles; Air pumps for bicycles; Bicycle motors; Bicycle 
pedals; Bicycle saddle covers; Bicycle stands; Bicycle tires; Electric bicycles; Frames for 
bicycles; Motorized bicycles,” are closely related to registrant’s goods and/or services, “Drinking 
bottles for sports; Drinking flasks.” 
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of Trek, All City Cycles, and Allied Cycle Works establishes 
that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant goods and/or services 
and markets the goods and/or services under the same mark. Specifically, these entities all make 
bicycles and parts and accessories for bicycles, including, water bottles. Thus, applicant’s and 
registrant’s goods and/or services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes. See, e.g., 
In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 
91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009). 
 
Accordingly, the goods and/or services are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of 
confusion analysis. 
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are identical and the goods and/or services are related, there is a PARTIAL 
likelihood of confusion as to the source of applicant’s goods and/or services, and registration is refused 
pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.
 
Note: This refusal only applies to some of applicant's goods, namely, "Bicycles; Air pumps for bicycles; 
Bicycle motors; Bicycle pedals; Bicycle saddle covers; Bicycle stands; Bicycle tires; Electric bicycles; 
Frames for bicycles; Motorized bicycles."

may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
