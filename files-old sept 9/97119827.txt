USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119827
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You may be required to respond to this Office action.  Follow the steps below.

(2) Respond to the Office action, if a response is required. Respond by deadline using the 
Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the 
USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. 
Otherwise, your application will be abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
•“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.NO CONFLICTING MARKS: 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
DISCLAIMER OF “HOMESCHOOL” REQUIRED: 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “HOMESCHOOL” because it is merely descriptive of an 
ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s services.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
"Homeschool" means "a school operated outside established educational institutions, especially in a 
home."  See attachments from https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=homeschool.
 
HOMESCHOOL immediately conveys to consumers that applicant's online retail store sells products 
for use at schools operated outside established educational institutions, especially in homes.  
Additionally, it also immediately informs consumers that applicant's educational services are 
about schools operated outside established educational institutions, especially in homes.  Indeed, 
applicant's ID includes the word "homeschooling".   
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “HOMESCHOOL” apart from the mark as 
shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove the 
disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.
 
The following cases further explain the disclaimer requirement: Dena Corp. v. Belvedere Int’l Inc., 950 
F.2d 1555, 21 USPQ2d 1047 (Fed. Cir. 1991); In re Brown-Forman Corp., 81 USPQ2d 1284 (TTAB 
2006); In re Kraft, Inc., 218 USPQ 571 (TTAB 1983).
 
TELEPHONE CALL SUGGESTED:
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney to resolve the issues in this Office 
action. Although the USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions, communication by 
phone or email is permissible to agree to proposed amendments to the application that will immediately 
place the application in condition for publication, registration, or suspension. See 37 C.F.R. §2.62(c); 
TMEP §707.

ability to timely respond.
•
