NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date

Issue date:  August 22, 2022
Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.Summary of Issues

Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Entity Uncertain-Name of Individual Applicant but Legal Entity is a Corporation 
 
The name of an individual person appears in the section of the application intended for the trademark 
owner’s name; however, the legal entity is set forth as a corporation. Applicant must clarify this 
inconsistency. TMEP §803.02(a); see 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), (a)(3)(i)-(ii), 2.61(b).
 
If applicant is an individual, applicant must request that the legal entity be amended to “individual” and 
must indicate his or her country of citizenship. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(i); TMEP §803.03(a). 
Alternatively, if applicant is a corporation, applicant must provide the legal name of the corporation 
and U.S. state or foreign country of incorporation or organization. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii); see TMEP 
§803.03(c).
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration will be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).
 
Unsigned Application 
 
The application was unsigned, resulting in the application not being properly verified. See TMEP §804. 
Applicant must properly sign and therefore verify the application in an affidavit or signed declaration 
under 37 C.F.R. §2.20. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.2(n), 2.33(a), (b)(2)-(c), 2.34(a)(2), (a)(3)(i), (a)(4)(ii); 
TMEP §804.02.
 
The following statements must be verified: That applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in 
commerce and had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the application filing date; 
that applicant believes applicant is entitled to use the mark in commerce on or in connection with the 
goods or services specified in the application; that to the best of the signatory’s knowledge and belief, 
no other persons, except, if applicable, concurrent users, have the right to use the mark in commerce, 
either in the identical form or in such near resemblance as to be likely, when used on or in connection 
with the goods/services of such other persons, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive; and that the 
facts set forth in the application are true. 37 C.F.R. §§2.33(b)(2), (c), 2.34(a)(2), (a)(3)(i), (a)(4)(ii).
 
For more information about the verified statement and instructions on providing one using the online 
Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see the Verified statement webpage.Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the requirements in this Office action. See TMEP §§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

GENERAL GUIDANCE

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
