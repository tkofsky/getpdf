NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:Identification of goods
•
Phone number required
•
 
ATTN: Sandeep Satti, President
 
SEARCH RESULT
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
THE FOLLOWING PARTIAL REQUIREMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE GOODS 
SPECIFIED THEREIN 
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS 
 
One of the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§1402.01.  Applicant must amend the identification to specify the common commercial or generic 
name of the goods.  See TMEP §1402.01.  If the goods have no common commercial or generic name, 
applicant must describe the product, its main purpose, and its intended uses.  See id.
 
The wording “etc.” in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified because it fails to 
identify specific goods. See TMEP §1402.03(a). Therefore, applicant must delete this indefinite 
wording from the identification and specify the common commercial or generic name for these goods.
 
In an identification, an applicant must use the common commercial or generic name for the goods, be 
specific and all-inclusive, and avoid using indefinite words or phrases. TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03(a). 
Further, applicant may amend the identification to list only those items that are within the scope of the 
goods set forth in the initial application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. Scope is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of the wording in 
the identification. TMEP §1402.07(a).
 
For easier reference, the suggested amendments are shown in bold and italics.
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate:  
 
Athletic protective pads for hands, wrists, ankle, arm, and knee; Athletic supporters; Athletic wraps for 
supporting hands, wrists, and ankle during exercise; Athletic sporting goods, namely, athletic wrist and 
joint supports; Shin guards for athletic use; Shoulder pads for athletic use; Wrist guards for athletic 
use, in international class 28.
 
Applicant’s goods may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those originally 
itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. 
Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting items to 
result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods or add 
goods not found or encompassed by those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 
TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). Any acceptable changes to the goods will further limit scope, and once goods 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, 
please see the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services 
Manual. See TMEP §1402.04.  To expedite prosecution of this trademark application, when 
amending the identification as required above, the Office strongly encourages the applicant to 
select pre-approved wording contained within this manual that accurately describes the goods 
and/or services therein.  Failure to do so may result in delay.
 
PHONE NUMBER
 
Applicant is requested to provide a current telephone number in the response to expedite examination 
of this application.
 
RESPONSE GUIDELINES
 
For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal and/or requirement in this 
Office action.  For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and evidence against the refusal, 
and may have other response options if specified above.  For a requirement, applicant should set forth 
the changes or statements.  Please see “Responding to Office Actions” and the informational video 
“Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on responding.
 
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) website provides information for those 
unfamiliar with the process of applying for federal trademark registration, such as an e-booklet about 
registering trademarks, FAQs, and more.  Two tools on the USPTO’s website that are particularly 
helpful during the examination process are the (1) informational videos and (2) application processing 
timelines.  The videos provide information in a broadcast news format regarding a range of issues that 
arise during the examination of an application, such as specimens and goods and services.  The 
application processing timelines provide information regarding the USPTO’s processing time for 
certain documents, as well as crucial legal deadlines.

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
