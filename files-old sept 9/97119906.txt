NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Domicile Address 
•
Identification of Goods 
•
Mark Significance
•
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
DOMICILE ADDRESS
 
Applicant must clarify its U.S. domicile address or appoint a qualified U.S.-licensed attorney. 
TMEP §601.01(b); see 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.61(b). Clarification is required because an applicant 
whose domicile is located outside of the United States or its territories must be represented at the 
USPTO by an attorney who is an active member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a 
U.S. state or territory. 37 C.F.R. §2.11(a); TMEP §601.01(a). U.S.-domiciled applicants, however, are 
not required to be represented. TMEP §601.01(b).
 
A domicile address must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place 
an individual applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal 
place of business, which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as an individual of China and specifies a U.S. street 
address as applicant’s domicile. It is unclear from the record whether the U.S. street address provided is 
the place applicant resides and intends to be applicant’s principal home.
 
Response options. Applicant must (1) provide documentation to support the referenced U.S. street 
address or (2) appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney qualified to practice under 37 C.F.R. §11.14 as its 
representative, before the application may proceed to registration. 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.61(b); TMEP 
§601.01(b). See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information.
 
To provide documentation supporting applicant’s U.S. domicile. Applicant must provide 
documentation showing the name and listed domicile address of the individual, for example one of the 
following: (1) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement; (2) a current, valid 
homeowner’s, renter’s, or motor vehicle insurance policy; or (3) a computer-generated bill issued by a 
utility company dated no earlier than 60 days before the application filing date. TMEP §601.01(b); see 
37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.61(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed domicile address, 
and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) 
response form and enter the serial number, answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional 
Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, click the button below the text box to 
attach documentation to support the U.S. street address.
 
To appoint a U.S.-licensed attorney in this application, applicant should submit a completed TEASChange Address or Representation form. The newly-appointed attorney must submit a TEAS Response 
to Examining Attorney Office Action form indicating that an appointment of attorney has been made 
and address all other refusals or requirements in this action, if any. Alternatively, if applicant retains an 
attorney before filing the response, the attorney can respond to this Office action by using the 
appropriate TEAS response form and provide his or her attorney information in the form and sign it as 
applicant’s attorney. See 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b)(1)(ii); TMEP §604.01.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
 
The wording “HDMI” in the identification of goods is a registered mark not owned by applicant; 
accordingly, applicant must amend the identification to delete this wording and, if not already included 
in the identification, provide the common commercial or generic name of the goods. TMEP §1402.09; 
see 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); Camloc Fastener Corp. v. Grant, 119 USPQ 264, 264 n.1 (TTAB 1958). See 
attached U.S. Registration No(s). 3268924 and 2900587.
 
Identifications of goods should generally be comprised of generic everyday wording for the goods, and 
exclude proprietary or potentially-proprietary wording, such as a registered term. See TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.09. The misspelling or phonetic equivalent of a registered mark should similarly be 
excluded, unless it is the common name of the goods. TMEP §1402.09. A registered mark indicates 
origin in one particular party and so may not be used to identify goods that originate in a party other 
than that registrant. TMEP §1402.09 (citing Camloc Fastener Corp. v. Grant, 119 USPQ at 264 n.1).
 
In addition, the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified because the exact nature of the 
nature of goods is not made clear to sufficiently identify those goods under the Office’s standards for 
identifications. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Such specificity of identifications provides 
public notice and enables the USPTO to reach informed judgments concerning likelihood of confusion 
under the Trademark Act.  Applicant must amend the identification to specify the common commercial 
or generic name of the goods. See TMEP §1402.01. If the goods have no common commercial or 
generic name, applicant must describe the product, its main purpose, and its intended uses. See id.  
 
Applicant must also correct the punctuation in the identification to clarify the individual items in the list 
of goods. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01(a). Proper punctuation in identifications is 
necessary to delineate explicitly each product or service within a list and to avoid ambiguity. Commas, 
semicolons, and apostrophes are the only punctuation that should be used in an identification of goods 
and/or services. TMEP §1402.01(a). An applicant should not use colons, periods, exclamation points, 
and question marks in an identification. Id. In addition, applicants should not use symbols in the 
identification such as asterisks (*), at symbols (@), or carets. Id.
 
In general, commas should be used in an identification (1) to separate a series of related items 
identified within a particular category of goods or services, (2) before and after “namely,” and (3) 
between each item in a list of goods or services following “namely” (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion, bar soap, shampoo). Id. Semicolons generally should be used to separate a series 
of distinct categories of goods or services within an international class (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion; deodorizers for pets; glass cleaners). Id.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:  
 
International 
Class 
009: 
{specify 
exact 
Class 
09 
type 
of 
adapter, 
e.g., 
electrical} adapter; {specify exact Class 09 type of charger, e.g., battery} charger; highdefinition multimedia interface cable 
 
Applicant should note that the above language in bold font indicates the examining attorney’s 
suggestions, and the braces indicate where applicant must insert specific types of goods.  The braces 
should not appear in the amended identification; only the specific goods indicated, as inserted by 
applicant.  Applicant need not amend its identification other than where specified by bold font. 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods, but not to broaden or expand the 
goods beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
EXPLANATION OF MARK’S SIGNIFICANCE REQUIRED
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must clarify whether wording in the mark 
has any particular significance, as follows:
 
(1) Industry significance. Explain whether the wording “OCSONIC” in the mark has any 
meaning or significance in the trade or industry in which applicant’s goods are manufactured or 
provided, any meaning or significance as applied to applicant’s goods, or if such wording is a 
term of art within applicant’s industry.
 
(2) Geographical significance. Explain whether this wording identifies a geographic place.
 
(3) Foreign language. Explain whether this wording has any meaning in a foreign language. If 
so, submit an English translation of the foreign wording in a mark.  
 
The format for an English translation: “The English translation of “OCSONIC” in the 
mark is “{specify meaning}”. 
 
The format for when there is no English translation or meaning of the transliteration: “The 
wording “OCSONIC” has no meaning in a foreign language.  
 
See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(9)-(a)(10), 2.61(b); TMEP §§809-809.03, 814. If the wording has no 
significance and is not a term of art in the relevant trade or industry or as used with applicant’s goods, 
and does not have any geographical or meaning in a foreign language, or any other significance, 
applicant must provide a statement to that effect. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §814.
 
To respond to the above requirement for information, open the appropriate Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and enter the serial number, answer “yes” to question 3, and 
on the “Additional Statement(s)” page in either the “Significance of Wording, Letter(s), or Numeral(s)” 
text box(es) and/or the “Miscellaneous Statement” text box(es), enter the information and/or explain 
documentation being submitted with such information and attach it by clicking the button below the 
text box.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In reOcean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
NO COMMUNICATION
 
Until applicant establishes its U.S. domicile, the assigned trademark examining attorney may not 
communicate with applicant by phone or email about this Office action or the application. See 37 
C.F.R. §§2.11(a), 2.18(a)(1)-(2); TMEP §709.02, .04. If applicant appoints a qualified U.S.-licensed 
attorney, the USPTO will communicate only with that attorney and not the applicant. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.18(a)(2); TMEP §609.01.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119906
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
