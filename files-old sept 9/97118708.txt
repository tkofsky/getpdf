NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 27, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Prior-Filed Application
•
Sections 1 and 45 Refusal - Unacceptable Specimen
•
Applicant Must Disclaim the Word "PASTA" 
•
 
 
PRIOR-FILED APPLICATION
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 79339014 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
When two or more applications contain marks that are conflicting such that there is a potential 
likelihood of confusion between the marks under Trademark Act Section 2(d), the mark in the 
application with the earliest effective filing date will have priority and proceed towards publication or 
registration, as appropriate, over the other applications. See 37 C.F.R. §2.83(a); TMEP §1208.01.
 
For applications based on Section 1, the effective filing date is the date the application is filed with the 
USPTO. See TMEP §§201, -.01, 1208.01(b). However, for applications claiming a “priority” filing date 
under Section 44(d) or 67, the effective filing date can be up to six months earlier than the date the 
application is filed in the United States. See 15 U.S.C. §§1126(d), 1141g; TMEP §§206.02, 1003.02, 
1208.01(b).
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
 
SECTIONS 1 AND 45 REFUSAL - UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMEN
 Registration is refused because the specimen does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in 
commerce in connection with any of the goods and/or services specified in International Classes 35 and 
43.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In 
re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79 (TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 
1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods and/or 
services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 
USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013). 
 
Specifically, the specimen shows a social media account with the name "THE PASTA TABLE".  
Although the specimen includes wording such as "ALL THINGS PASTA" and "ASPIRING PASTA 
GRANNY", there is nothing in the specimen which indicates that the applicant is providing the services 
identified in Classes 35 or 43.  Accordingly, the specimen is not acceptable for these classes.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include:  (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of businesssignage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the 
goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.”  The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing 
an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before 
publication.  This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, 
including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage. 
 
If applicant responds to the refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
 
APPLICANT MUST DISCLAIM THE WORD "PASTA"
Applicant must disclaim the wording “PASTA” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
Here, the applicant's specimen shows a variety of pasta dishes and includes the descriptor "ALL 
THINGS PASTA".  This shows that applicant's services relate to pasta.  Accordingly, the word 
"PASTA" is merely descriptive of a characteristic of the services.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “PASTA” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.Please email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 27, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118708
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
