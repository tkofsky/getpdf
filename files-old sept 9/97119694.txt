NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
REFUSAL OF REGISTRATION UNDER SECTION 2(d) OF THE TRADEMARK ACT - 
CONFUSING SIMILARITY
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 5864391 and 5425303. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-
by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 
1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 
F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those 
factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in 
every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) 
(quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 1747 
(quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1380 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 
24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the cumulative 
effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods and differences in the marks.”); TMEP 
§1207.01.
 
SIMILARITY OF THE MARKS
 
First the marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.” 
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b). The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks. In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 
(TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP 
§1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir.2014).
 
Applicant has applied for registration of the mark 3RD SHOT GOLF in standard character form.  The 
registered marks are both THIRD SHOT DROP and design.  
 
First, it is noted that a mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in any lettering style; the 
rights reside in the wording or other literal element and not in any particular display or rendition. See In 
re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 
601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. §2.52(a); TMEP 
§1207.01(c)(iii). That is, the registered marks here - both presented in stylized characters and with a 
design element - generally will not avoid likelihood of confusion with applicant's standard characters 
mark because applicant's word portion could be presented in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In 
re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 
216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that “the argument concerning a difference in type style is 
not viable where one party asserts rights in no particular display”).  
 
Next, although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or 
dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 
USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 
1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Greater weight is often given to this 
dominant feature when determining whether marks are confusingly similar. See In re Detroit Athletic 
Co., 903 F.3d at 1305, 128 USPQ2d at 1050 (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d at 1407, 41 USPQ2d at 
1533-34).
 
When evaluating a composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is normally 
accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be 
remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods. In re Aquitaine Wine USA, 
LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 
USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks must be 
compared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is accorded 
greater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word portion has 
been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant Food, Inc. 
v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).
 
In the present case, it would be the wording "THIRD SHOT DROP" in registrant's marks that would 
dominate over the design portion of those marks, be remembered by consumers, and used by them to 
call for the goods.
 
Further still, not only do consumers remember the wording/literal portion of a mark over the design 
portion, but it is well settled that consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word(s), 
prefix(es), or syllable(s) of that word portion of the trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., 
Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 
1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT 
marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the 
first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 
876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and 
CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because “consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead 
word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 
2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial words is particularly significant becauseconsumers typically notice those words first”).
 
Thus, in the present case, the focus or recollection of the consumer will likely be on the wording "3RD 
SHOT" in applicant's mark, and "THIRD SHOT" in registrant's marks.  As to that dominant portion, the 
parties' marks are identical in sound and meaning.
 
SIMILARITY OF THE GOODS
 
Next, the goods are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in 
the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 
1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods] emanate from 
the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 
1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 
2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Applicant's goods are identified as:  "Hats; Shirts; T-shirts; Golf pants, shirts and skirts; Polo shirts".
 
The goods named in the registrations are:
 
RN 5864391:  "Baseball caps; Baseball caps and hats; Short-sleeved or long-sleeved t-shirts; Sleeveless 
jerseys; Sweatshirts; T-shirts; Tee-shirts; Tee shirts; Visors being headwear; Graphic T-shirts; Hooded 
sweatshirts; Sun visors being  headgear"; and 
 
RN 5425303:  "Sleeveless jerseys; Sweatshirts; Tee shirts; Visors being headwear; Baseball caps; 
Baseball caps and hats; Hooded sweatshirts; Short-sleeved or long-sleeved t-shirts; Sun visors being 
headgear".
 
When analyzing an applicant’s and registrant’s goods for similarity and relatedness, that determination 
is based on the description of the goods in the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic 
evidence of actual use. See Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1323, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Octocom Sys. Inc. v. Hous. Computers Servs. Inc., 
918 F.2d 937, 942, 16 USPQ2d 1783, 1787 (Fed. Cir. 1990)).
 
In this case, some of the goods in the application and registration(s) are identical - for example, t-shirts, 
hats. Therefore, it is presumed that the channels of trade and class(es) of purchasers are the same for 
these goods. See Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1372, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 
2018) (quoting In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)). 
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are related.
 
Moreover, the application here uses broad wording to describe its hats and shirts, which presumably 
encompasses all goods of the type described, including the5864391 registrant's more narrow baseball 
caps and hats, sun visors, and "Short-sleeved or long-sleeved t-shirts; Sleeveless jerseys; Sweatshirts;T-shirts; Tee-shirts; Tee shirts; Visors being headwear; Graphic T-shirts; Hooded sweatshirts", and 
the5425303 registrant's "Sleeveless jerseys; Sweatshirts; Tee shirts; Visors being headwear; Baseball 
caps; Baseball caps and hats; Hooded sweatshirts; Short-sleeved or long-sleeved t-shirts".  See, e.g., In 
re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, 
Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally 
identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo 
Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 
1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. 
Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)). 
 
Finally, the parties' goods all comprise clothing items.  Neither the application nor the registration(s) 
contains any limitations regarding trade channels for the goods and therefore it is assumed that 
registrant’s and applicant’s goods are sold everywhere that is normal for such items, i.e., clothing and 
department stores. Thus, it can also be assumed that the same classes of purchasers shop for these items 
and that consumers are accustomed to seeing them sold under the same or similar marks. See Kangol 
Ltd. v. KangaROOS U.S.A., Inc., 974 F.2d 161, 23 USPQ2d 1945 (Fed. Cir. 1992); In re Smith & 
Mehaffey, 31 USPQ2d 1531 (TTAB 1994); TMEP §1207.01(a)(iii).
 
CONCLUSION
 
In view of the similarity of the marks and the goods of the parties, confusion as to the source of the 
goods is likely such that the average clothing consumer may be led to mistakenly believe that 3RD 
SHOT GOLF is the golf clothing line from the same source as the THIRD SHOT DROP clothing 
people.  The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods, 
but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer. See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination must be resolved in favor of the 
registrant. TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, the refusal of registration under Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act, based on a likelihood 
of confusion between applicant's mark and the marks in U.S. Registration Nos. 5864391 and 
5425303, is proper.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
•
