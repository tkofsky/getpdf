SPECIMEN REFUSAL
 
Specimen pages 1 - 3 and 9 - 14
 
Digitally created or altered image or mockup is not an acceptable specimen.  Registration is 
refused because the specimen appears to consist of a digitally created or altered image or a mockup of a 
depiction of the mark on the goods or their packaging and does not show the applied-for mark as 
actually used in commerce in International Class(es) 12.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (c); TMEP §§904.04(a)(iii), 904.07(a). 
 
An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for 
mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a).  “Use in commerce” means (1) a bona fide use of the applied-for mark in the ordinary course 
of trade (and not merely to reserve a right in the mark), (2) the mark is placed in any manner on the 
goods, packaging, tags or labels affixed to the goods, or displays that directly associate the mark with 
the goods and have a point-of-sale nature, and (3) the goods are actually sold or transported in 
commerce.  See 15 U.S.C. §1127.
 
An image of a product or packaging that has been digitally created or altered to include the mark or a 
mockup of how the mark may be displayed on the product or packaging is not a proper specimen for 
goods because it does not show actual use of the mark in commerce.  See 15 U.S.C. §1127; 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(c); TMEP §904.04(a)(i).
 
In this case, the specimen submitted appears to show the applied-for mark digitally imposed on the 
goods and not on the goods themselves as they appear to hover over the goods.  Therefore, the 
specimen does not show actual use of the mark in commerce. 
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to the specimen refusal by satisfying one of the following 
options for each applicable international class: 
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual use in 
commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of an 
amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the goods 
identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified substitute specimen” is a 
specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in a signed affidavit or supported 
by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, ifappropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the 
application or prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.”  The substitute specimen 
cannot be accepted without this statement.  For instructions on how to submit a different 
specimen using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Specimen webpage.
 
Applicants submitting a webpage as a specimen for goods must include the URL and the date the 
page was accessed or printed either directly on the specimen itself or in a separate statement, 
supported by an affidavit or declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 verifying such information.  See 
37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing an 
amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before publication.  This 
option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, including a specimen.
 
If applicant submits an acceptable verified substitute specimen or amends to Section 1(b), the 
requirement below for additional information/documentation about the original specimen will be 
withdrawn.  The requirement below as to the original specimen will be made final if applicant submits 
a substitute specimen that is not acceptable or does not amend to Section 1(b), and does not also 
respond completely to the requirement below.
 
Specimen pages 4 - 8
 
Webpage specimen does not include required URL and/or date printed/accessed. Registration is 
refused because the specimen is not acceptable as a webpage specimen; it lacks the required URL. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a). Thus, it is unclear whether the specimen shows the 
applied-for mark in actual use in commerce. See Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.03(g), 904.07(a). An application based on 
Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in 
commerce for each international class of goods and services identified in the application or amendment 
to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a). Because the webpage specimen lacks the associated 
URL, within the TEAS form used to submit the specimen, or in a verified statement in a later-filed 
response, it is unacceptable to show use of the mark in commerce. TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include: 
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R.§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a verified statement, in a signed affidavit or supported by a 
declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746, specifying the URL of the 
original webpage specimen and the date it was accessed or printed.
 
(2)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen), including 
the URL and date accessed/printed directly on the specimen itself or in a separate 
statement, that (a) was in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the 
application or prior to the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark 
in actual use in commerce for the goods and/or services identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use. Applicant must also submit the following statement made in a 
signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce 
at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the 
amendment to allege use.”
 
(3)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Specimen Page 15
 
Material used only to conduct internal business is not an acceptable specimen. Registration is 
refused because the specimen is merely material used by applicant to conduct its internal business and 
does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for International Class(es) 12. 
Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP 
§§904, 904.04(b), 904.07(a). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a 
specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of 
goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Material used by an applicant only to conduct its internal business is not an acceptable specimen for 
goods. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(a); In re Chi. Rawhide Mfg. Co., 455 F.2d 563, 565, 173 USPQ 8, 9 
(C.C.P.A. 1972); In re Bright of Am., Inc., 205 USPQ 63, 71 (TTAB 1979); TMEP §904.04(b). “These 
materials include all documents whose sole function is to carry out the applicant’s business dealings, 
such as invoices, bill heads, waybills, warranties, and business stationery.” TMEP §904.04(b); see e.g., 
In re Chi. Rawhide Mfg. Co., 455 F.2d at 565, 173 USPQ at 9; In re Bright of Am., Inc., 205 USPQ at 
65.
 
Specifically, the specimen consists of an invoice for a purchase of the goods, which is merely aninternal business document and is not showing the applied-for mark in use in commerce for third-
parties.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c).  Any webpage 
printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was 
accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a 
verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in 
commerce for the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following 
statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. 
§2.20: “The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) 
was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or 
prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be 
accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED  
 
Additional information/documentation about original specimen(s) required.  To permit proper 
examination of the application record for compliance with use in commerce requirements, applicant 
must respond to the following requirement for information and documentation about the specimen(s).  
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§814, 904.04(a)(iii).  A specimen must show the mark as actually used 
in commerce, which means use in the ordinary course of trade, and not merely to reserve a right in the 
trademark.  15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1052, 1127.  Because the specimen of record appears to be digitally 
created or altered, or is a mockup, further information is necessary to determine whether the specimen 
is in actual use in commerce. 
 
Answer for each specimen/photograph/image previously provided.  For any website source,applicant must provide (1) an image of the webpage, (2) the date it was accessed or printed, and (3) the 
complete URL address.  In re ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (TTAB 2020) 
(citing In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018)); TMEP §710.01(b).  Providing only a 
website address or hyperlink to the webpage is not sufficient to make the materials of record.  In re 
ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (citing In re Olin Corp., 124 USPQ2d 1327, 
1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB Solomon Assocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); 
TBMP §1208.03); TMEP §814.
 
(1)  Identify the particular good(s) listed in the application for which the specimen(s) was 
submitted to show use of the mark.
 
(2)  Explain whether the specimen was created for submission with this application.  If so, 
specify the date each specimen was created.  If applicant used the image(s) of the goods shown in 
the specimen(s) from a third-party website, provide the URL of the website and a digital copy of 
relevant webpage(s) for each image.
 
(3)  Provide information about and examples of how applicant’s goods appear in the actual sales 
environment.
(a)  If sold in stores, provide a representative sample of the name(s) of the stores and of 
photographs showing the goods for sale in the named stores, such as photographs of the 
sales displays or goods on shelves with the mark. 
(b)  If sold online, provide a representative sample of the name(s) of the online retailers, 
the website URL(s) for each named retailer, and a digital copy of the webpages showing 
the goods for sale on the named website.
(c)  If sold in another type of sales environment (e.g., catalogs, trade shows), identify the 
environment and provide photographs and/or documentation showing the goods for sale in 
that environment. 
 
(4)  If the information in question (3) about how the goods appear in the actual sales environment 
is not available to applicant, please describe how applicant’s goods are sold or transported and 
provide photographs and other documentation showing how applicant’s mark appears on the 
goods and/or its packaging when the goods are sold or transported to or within the United States.
 
(5)  For each category of sales environment specified in response to questions (3) and (4), specify 
when the goods bearing the mark were first available for purchase within the United States, the 
date of the first sale of the goods to or within the United States, and whether the goods are still 
for sale to or within the United States in that environment.
 
(6)  For the goods identified in response to question (1), provide documentation that shows 
payment or other consideration made for the goods, redacting personal or private information of 
buyers as necessary.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information.  See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814.  Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration.  In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).RESPONSE GUIDELINES

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 26, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119226
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
