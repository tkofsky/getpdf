United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)

U.S. Application Serial No. 97120255
Mark:  STRATEGIC.AI
Correspondence Address:  
STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, INC. 
12232 BLACK WALNUT COURT 
JACKSONVILLE FL 32226 UNITED STATES
Applicant:  Strategic Communications, Inc.
Reference/Docket No. N/A
Correspondence Email Address:  tmapplicationfilings@amerilawyer.com
 
 
NONFINAL OFFICE ACTIONThe USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issues below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Disclaimer Required
•
Amendments to the Identification Required
•
Amendments to the Description of the Mark Required 
•
Amendments to the Color Claim Required 
•
 
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “STRATEGIC AI” because it is merely descriptive of a quality, 
characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); 
DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 
(Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove the 
disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.
 
The services in the present application are for "cx automation and business continuity technical 
advisors".  The attached evidence from technology providers demonstrates that "strategic AI" is a type 
and method of providing automation and technology advice using artificial intelligence or 
"AI".  See https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/blog/5-ways-your-ai-projects-fail-part-2-strategic-ai-
failures; https://www.technossus.com/2021/03/how-to-identify-strategic-ai-use-
cases/; https://www.comparebusinessproducts.com/resources/item/6-strategic-ai-enhancements-for-
your-crm; https://striatumtech.com/vidora-strategic-
ai/; https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/9781800611337_0003; https://www.kungfu.ai/; https://bernardmarr.com/how-
to-develop-an-artificial-intelligence-strategy-9-things-every-business-must-
include/; https://grabb.ai/api/.  Thus, the wording “STRATEGIC.AI” in the applied-for mark 
immediately names and merely describes a quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, and use of 
applicant’s services.The wording “STRATEGIC.AI” must appear in its correct spelling, i.e., “STRATEGIC AI” in the 
disclaimer. See In re Omaha Nat’l Corp., 819 F.2d 1117, 1119, 2 USPQ2d 1859, 1861 (Fed. Cir. 1987); 
In re Carlson, 91 USPQ2d 1198, 1203 (TTAB 2009); TMEP §1213.08(c).
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “STRATEGIC AI” apart from the mark as 
shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
 
AMENDMENTS TO THE IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED 
 
The identification of services is indefinite and must be amended to specify the common commercial or 
generic name of the services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.If the services have no 
common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe or explain the nature of the services 
using clear and succinct language. See id.  First, the wording "cx automation" must be amended to state 
the common commercial or generic name of these customer experience automation services.  Second, 
the wording "business continuity technical advisors" must also be amended to indicate the common 
commercial or generic name of the business continuity technical advisement services. 
 
See the bold text below for acceptable options for amendments.  
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand the 
services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying services in trademark applications, please see the 
USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See TMEP 
§1402.04.
 
Applicant may adopt the following wording, if accurate:   
 
International Class 042:  Providing customer experience (CX) automation through 
a data automation and collection service using proprietary software to evaluate, 
analyze and collect service data; business continuity technical advisors for computer 
disaster recovery planning, namely, providing technical advice relating to operation 
of computers, electronic data back-up services, and recovery of computer data for 
business continuity  
 
 
AMENDMENTS TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MARK REQUIRED 
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark that agrees with the mark on the drawing. 
37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. The current description is inconsistent with the mark on 
the drawing and thus is inaccurate. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. Descriptions must beaccurate and identify only those literal and design elements appearing in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §2.37; 
TMEP §§808.02, 808.03(d).
 
When an applicant submits a drawing showing the mark in color, applicant’s color claim and 
description must reference all the colors in the mark, including black, white and/or gray. TMEP 
§807.07(d); see 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 2.52(b)(1). If portions of white are not a color feature of the mark, 
applicant must provide a statement in the description that the additional white represents background, 
outlining, shading and/or transparent areas and are not part of the mark. TMEP §807.07(d).
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate:  
 
The mark consists of a design of a blue and white globe depicting continents and 
meridians and parallels, with blue shadowing under the globe and with three, white 
curved lines outlined in blue, intersecting the globe, to the left of the stylized wording 
"STRATEGIC.AI" in blue, with blue, white and gray outlining and shadowing.  The 
other white is not claimed as a feature of the mark and represents background and 
transparent areas. 
 
 
AMENDMENTS TO THE COLOR CLAIM REQUIRED 
 
In connection with the above description for a color drawing, a complete list of all the colors claimed as 
a feature of the mark must be proveded.  As noted above, the applied-for mark drawing also appears to 
contain the color gray.  Therefore, applicant must provide a corrected color claim that lists all the colors 
in the mark drawing. See 37 C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(i).  
 
The following corrected color claim is suggested, if accurate: 
 
The colors blue, white and gray are claimed as a feature of the mark. 
 
TMEP §807.07(a)(i).

Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE

on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120255
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE

Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
