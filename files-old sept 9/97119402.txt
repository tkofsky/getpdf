NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL  
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
each of the below listed U.S. Registration Nos.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See each attached registration.
 
6731639 BANGIN' BANGIN' for Bar services; Catering services; Providing of food and drink 
via a mobile 
truck; Restaurant services; Serving of food and drink/beverages. 
6084143 BANGIN BUNS HOT CHICKEN & design for Restaurant services; Restaurant 
services, including sit-down service of food and take-out restaurant services; Restaurant services, 
namely, providing of food and beverages for 
consumption on and off the premises; Fast casual restaurants featuring chicken; Fast-food 
restaurant 
services.  
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
COMPARISON OF MARKS 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).In this instance, applicant’s mark is BANGIN' FISH & CHICKEN with "fish & chicken" disclaimed.  
Although applicant’s mark is marginally stylized, the registrants' marks are either a standard character 
mark, or, reinforce the association with chicken with the image of a chicken.  A mark in typed or 
standard characters may be displayed in any lettering style; the rights reside in the wording or other 
literal element and not in any particular display or rendition. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 
1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 
USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. §2.52(a); TMEP §1207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a mark 
presented in stylized characters and/or with a design element generally will not avoid likelihood of 
confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters because the word portion could be presented in 
the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; 
Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that “the 
argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable where one party asserts rights in no 
particular display”).  Where "chicken" is the primary and disclaimed featured dish for each of the 
restaurants, the appearance of the design of a chicken merely strengthens, rather than distances, the 
likelihood that source confusion between restaurants featuring chicken would exist among consumers 
desiring a meal of chicken.  
 
The use of the portion “BANGIN” thus creates the dominant source indicating feature of the applicant's 
mark. Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant 
or dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 
128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 
1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Greater weight is often given to this 
dominant feature when determining whether marks are confusingly similar. See In re Detroit Athletic 
Co., 903 F.3d at 1305, 128 USPQ2d at 1050 (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d at 1407, 41 USPQ2d at 
1533-34).  
 
Each mark uses the same portion and thus creates a likelihood of source confusion.  
 
COMPARISON OF GOODS/SERVICES  
 
In this instance, applicant’s services are recited as "Restaurant" thus encompassing all those of the 
registrants, including the more narrowly recited types of restaurants, such as  "Fast casual restaurants 
featuring chicken" which is a mainstay of applicant's featured food as well.  
 
When analyzing an applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services for similarity and relatedness, that 
determination is based on the description of the goods and/or services in the application and registration 
at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use. See Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital 
LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1323, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Octocom Sys. Inc. v. 
Hous. Computers Servs. Inc., 918 F.2d 937, 942, 16 USPQ2d 1783, 1787 (Fed. Cir. 1990)).
 
In this case, the goods and/or services in the application and registration(s) are identical. Therefore, it is 
presumed that the channels of trade and class(es) of purchasers are the same for these goods and/or 
services. See Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1372, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 
2018) (quoting In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)). 
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
Hence, the overall similarities between the Registrant’s and Applicant’s marks and goods and/or 
services, and the commercial impressions that they create, are greater than the differences, and refusal 
of registration of Applicant’s mark under Section 2(d) is appropriate.If applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below.
 
PRIOR-FILED APPLICATION
 
The filing date of pending of each  U.S. Application Serial No. 97036883 and 97041534 precedes 
applicant’s filing date.  See attached referenced applications.  If the mark in the referenced application 
registers, applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a 
likelihood of confusion between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP 
§§1208 et seq.  Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this 
application may be suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
