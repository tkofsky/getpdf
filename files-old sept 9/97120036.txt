PARTIAL SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL - LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION - CLASS 30 ONLY
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 4707781, 3604528, and 5041828. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
 
Applicant's mark is LIFENATURE (standard characters) for, in relevant part, “Honey; Salt; Sauces; 
Spices; Tea; Dried herbs; Processed cereals” in International Class 030.
 
The cited marks are as follows:
 
NATURE'S LIFE (standard characters) (Reg. No. 4707781) for, in relevant part, “Edible oils; whey; 
vegetable protein powder for use as a food additive for culinary purposes” in International Class 029;NATURE'S LIFE (stylized characters plus design) (Reg. No. 3604528) for “Various health and beauty 
items, namely, body and face lotions, body and face creams, and body and face gels” in International 
Class 003, “Nutritional and dietary supplements” in International Class 005, and “Edible oils; whey; 
and vegetable protein powder for use as a food additive” in International Class 029;
 
NATURALIFE (standard characters) (Reg. No. 5041828) for “Processed cereal-based food to be used 
as a breakfast food, snack food or ingredient for making other foods” in International Class 030;
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When evaluating a composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is normally 
accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be 
remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods and/or services. In re 
Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks 
must be compared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is 
accorded greater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word 
portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant 
Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 
1983)). In this case, consumers would focus on the terms over any marks that also include designs.
 
Confusion is likely between two marks consisting of reverse combinations of the same elements if they 
convey the same meaning or create substantially similar commercial impressions. TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(vii); see, e.g., In re Wine Soc’y of Am. Inc., 12 USPQ2d 1139, 1142 (TTAB 1989) 
(holding THE WINE SOCIETY OF AMERICA and design for wine club membership services 
including the supplying of printed materials likely to be confused with AMERICAN WINE SOCIETY 
1967 and design for newsletters, bulletins, and journals); In re Nationwide Indus. Inc., 6 USPQ2d 1882, 
1884 (TTAB 1988) (holding RUST BUSTER for a rust-penetrating spray lubricant likely to be 
confused with BUST RUST for a penetrating oil). In this case, the applied-for mark is "LIFENATURE" 
and Reg. Nos.  4707781 and 3604528 reverse the terms, which does not change the meaning or overall 
commercial impression of the marks.
 
The ending of the registered marks 4707781 and 3604528 include an apostrophe and letter “s.” This 
additional matter has little, if any, trademark significance and does not otherwise affect the overall 
similarity of the marks in terms of commercial impression. See In re Binion, 93 USPQ2d 1531, 1534 
(TTAB 2009) (noting that “[t]he absence of the possessive form in applicant’s mark . . . has little, if 
any, significance for consumers in distinguishing it from the cited mark”); In re Curtice-Burns, Inc., 
231 USPQ 990, 992 (TTAB 1986) (finding the marks McKENZIE’S and McKENZIE “virtually 
identical in commercial impression”); Winn’s Stores, Inc. v. Hi-Lo, Inc., 203 USPQ 140, 143 (TTAB1979) (noting that “little if any trademark significance can be attributed to the apostrophe and the letter 
‘s’ in opposer’s mark”).
 
Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of 
terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See 
Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), 
aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 
1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH 
confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM 
and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii). 
 Here, the applied-for mark and Reg. No. 5041828 both contain the term "LIFE". Further, both marks 
include "NATUR", creating a similar overall meaning and commercial impression. 
 
Further, the reverse of "NATUR" and "LIFE" in the applied-for mark and in Reg. No. 5041828 does 
not change the meaning or overall commercial impression. TMEP §1207.01(b)(vii); see, e.g., In re 
Wine Soc’y of Am. Inc., 12 USPQ2d 1139, 1142 (TTAB 1989) (holding THE WINE SOCIETY OF 
AMERICA and design for wine club membership services including the supplying of printed materials 
likely to be confused with AMERICAN WINE SOCIETY 1967 and design for newsletters, bulletins, 
and journals); In re Nationwide Indus. Inc., 6 USPQ2d 1882, 1884 (TTAB 1988) (holding RUST 
BUSTER for a rust-penetrating spray lubricant likely to be confused with BUST RUST for a 
penetrating oil).
 
Because the marks look and sound similar and create the same commercial impression, the marks are 
considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.
 
Relatedness of the Goods 
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
NATURE'S LIFE (standard characters) (Reg. No. 4707781) and NATURE'S LIFE (stylized characters 
plus design) (Reg. No. 3604528)
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots from Estero Bay, Nicholas Vahe, and Bona 
Furtuna, establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides salt, spices, 
herbs, or tea as well as edible oils and markets the goods and/or services under the same mark.  Thus, 
applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are considered related for likelihood of confusionpurposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re 
Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
 
NATURALIFE (standard characters) (Reg. No. 5041828) 
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots of Cheerios, Fruit Loops, and Frosted Flakes, 
establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides processed cereals as 
well as processed cereal-based food to be used as a breakfast food or snack, and markets the goods 
and/or services under the same mark.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are 
considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 
USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 
1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
To the extent the evidence may not address all of the items in applicant’s identification, relatedness 
does not have to be established for every good or service.  It is sufficient for a finding of likelihood of 
confusion if relatedness is established for any or some item(s) encompassed by the identification within 
a particular class in an application. Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. General Mills Fun Group, 648 F.2d 1335, 
209 USPQ 986, 988 (CCPA 1981).  In this case, relatedness has been established for many of the 
identified items, which is enough to show a likelihood of confusion.
 
Accordingly, the goods are considered related for purpose of the likelihood of confusion analysis.
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods are related, there is a likelihood of confusion as to the 
source of applicant's goods. 
 
 
Response Options
 
Applicant may respond to the stated refusal by submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal.  
In addition, applicant may respond by doing one of the following:
 
(1)  Deleting the class to which the refusal pertains;
 
(2)  Filing a Request to Divide Application form (form #3) to divide out the goods and/or 
services that have not been refused registration, so that the mark may proceed toward publication 
for opposition in the class(es) to which the refusal does not pertain.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.87.  See 
generally TMEP §§1110 et seq. (regarding the requirements for filing a request to divide).  If 
applicant files a request to divide, then to avoid abandonment, applicant must also file a timely 
response to all outstanding issues in this Office action, including the refusal.  37 C.F.R. §2.87(e).; 
or
 
(3)  Amending the basis, if appropriate.  TMEP §806.03(h).  (The basis cannot be changed for 
applications filed under Trademark Act Section 66(a).  TMEP §1904.01(a).)
 
 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  However, if applicant responds to therefusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below. 
 
ENTITY CLARIFICATION 
 
The application identifies applicant as BTE Reklam Ltd. Sti., a “Limited Sirketi.” This is not an 
acceptable legal entity designation because it does not identify a particular type of legal entity in the 
United States. See TMEP §803.03. Further, Appendix D of the TMEP only lists "TLS" as a "Limited 
Sirketi" in Turkey. Therefore, applicant must specify the particular type of legal entity applying, e.g., 
corporation, association, partnership, or joint venture, and provide the additional information explained 
below about that entity. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(3)(ii)-(v), 2.61(b); TMEP §803.03. Applicant may also 
provide clarifying documentation or information that it is a "Limited Sirketi".
 
If applicant is a corporation, applicant must specify the U.S. state or foreign country under which it is 
incorporated. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(ii); TMEP §803.03(c).
 
If applicant is an association, applicant must specify the U.S. state or foreign country under whose laws 
the applicant is organized or exists, and indicate whether the association is incorporated or 
unincorporated. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(ii); TMEP §803.03(c).
 
If applicant is a partnership, applicant must specify the U.S. state or foreign country under whose laws 
the partnership is organized. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(ii); TMEP §803.03(b). In addition, for a U.S. 
partnership, applicant must list, if not yet specified, the names, legal entities, and national citizenship 
(for individuals), or the U.S. state or foreign country of organization or incorporation (for businesses) 
of all general partners. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(iii). For foreign partnerships, the names and citizenships of 
the general partners are not required. See TMEP §803.03(b).
 
If applicant is a joint venture, applicant must specify the U.S. state or foreign country under whose laws 
the joint venture is organized. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(ii); TMEP §803.03(b). In addition, for a U.S. joint 
venture, applicant must list the names, legal entities, and national citizenship (for individuals) or the 
U.S. state or foreign country of organization or incorporation (for businesses) of all active members of 
the joint venture. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(iv); TMEP §803.03(b). For foreign joint ventures, the names and 
citizenships of the active members are not required. TMEP §803.03(b).
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration will be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191;

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120036
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
