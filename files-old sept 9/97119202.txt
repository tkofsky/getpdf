2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.

SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Specimens Unacceptable 
•
 
REQUIREMENT
 
Before this application can proceed in the registration process, the following issue must be addressed.
 
A.  Specimens Unacceptable
 
Applicant has submitted specimens showing closeups of the mark (in the form "GET SOME 
RACING") imprinted on the upper left chest area of t-shirts and on the front/back of shirts, on the front 
of decals, and on a white board on a tabletop where goods are displayed and sold.
 
Mark in Drawing Differs from Mark on Specimens (Mark Imprinted on Shirts)
 
The following refusal/requirement pertains only to the specimens showing the mark imprinted on 
clothing.
 
Registration is refused because the specimens do not show the mark in the drawing in use in commerce 
in International Class 25, which is required in the application or amendment to allege use. Trademark 
Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). The mark appearing on the specimen and in the drawing must match; that is, 
the mark in the drawing “must be a substantially exact representation of the mark” on the specimen. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.51(a)-(b); TMEP §807.12(a).
 
In this case, the closeup specimens display the mark as "GET SOME RACING" (with a space between 
"GET" and "SOME" and with the addition of the word "RACING"). However, the drawing displays the 
mark as "GETSOME" (without any space and omitting the word "RACING"). In the photograph 
showing the shirts displayed on a table, the mark is only partially visible on the front of the shirts and it 
is not possible to see if the mark appears in the same form as in the drawing or if other matter (such as 
"RACING") is included.  The marks imprinted on the specimens do not match the mark in the 
drawing.  Applicant has thus failed to provide the required evidence of use of the mark in commerce. 
See TMEP §807.12(a).
 
Mark Shown on Decals is Not Used with Identified Goods
 
Registration is refused because the decal specimen does not show the applied-for mark as actually used 
in commerce in connection with any of the goods specified in International Class 25.  Trademark Act 
Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Keep A Breast 
Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79 (TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An 
application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for 
mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods and/or services identified in 
the application or amendment to allege use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv),2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 
(TTAB 2013). 
 
White Board as Shown is Not An Acceptable Store Display 
 
Registration is refused because the specimen in International Class 25 is not acceptable as a display 
associated with the goods; thus, the specimen does not properly show the applied-for mark as actually 
used in commerce. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (b)(1); TMEP §§904, 904.03(g), 904.07(a). An application based on 
Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in 
commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application or amendment to allege 
use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Product display specimens (1) must show use of the mark directly associated with the goods and (2) 
such use must be of a point-of-sale nature. 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1). In this case, the specimen does not 
show the display matter directly associated with the goods. Specifically, it is not clear from the 
photograph whether the white board is using "GETSOME" in a trademark fashion on a display 
associated with the goods or as an indication of what wording the decals feature.  The wording on the 
white board is mostly illegible.
 
Accordingly, such material is mere advertising, which is not acceptable as a specimen for goods. See In 
re Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 265039, at *15-16 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re Siny Corp., 
920 F.3d 1331, 1336, 2019 USPQ2d 127099, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. 2019)); see also Avakoff v. S. Pac. Co., 
765 F.2d 1097, 1098, 226 USPQ 435, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §904.04(b), (c).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) for each 
applicable international class that (a) shows the mark in the drawing in actual use in 
commerce for the goods and/or services in the application or amendment to allege use, and 
(b) was in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or 
prior to the filing of an amendment to allege use.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(2)        Submit a request to amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 
1(b) (which includes withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no 
specimen is required before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s)and filing requirements such as providing a specimen.
 
The USPTO will not accept an amended drawing showing the mark in the form shown imprinted on the 
clothing goods ("GET SOME RACING") submitted in response to this refusal because the changes 
would materially alter the drawing of the mark in the original application or as previously acceptably 
amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b); TMEP §807.14. Specifically, while the presentation of "GET 
SOME" as one word or two is not a material alteration, addition of the distinctive term "RACING" 
changes the focus of "GET SOME" and its omission from the mark is a material alternation.
 
For more information about drawings and instructions on how to satisfy these response options using 
the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Drawing webpage.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
