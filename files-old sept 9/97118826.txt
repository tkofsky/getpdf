SECTION 2(d) - LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 5173687 and 5605568.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods of the parties.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-
by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 
1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”).  In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 
F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Any evidence of record related to those 
factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in 
every case.”  In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) 
(quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods.  See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 
1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 
USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the 
cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01. 
 
The applicant seeks registration of the mark “GIRL UNDISCOVERED WASH AWAY THE WILD 
GENTLE FACE CLEANSING GEL” for “Cosmetics; non-medicated facial cleanser; non-medicated 
skin cleanser; cleansing bar; soap; makeup remover,” in International Class 003. 
 
Registrant owns U.S. Registration No. 5173687 for the mark “GIRL UNDISCOVERED” for
 
“Non-medicated preparations for the care, treatment and beautification of the skin; skin care

repellent, hair lotions and hair care preparations, toys, games; business management advisory 
services relating to franchising services; information, advisory and consultancy services for the 
foregoing,” in International Class 035.
 
Registrant also owns the mark in U.S. Registration No. 5605568 is “GIRL UNDISCOVERED” for 
“Medicated skin care preparations, namely, creams, lotions, gels, toners, cleaners and peels; medicated 
skin care preparations, consisting predominately of zinc, namely, creams, lotions, gels, toners, cleaners 
and peels; medicated lotions for treating dermatological conditions; medicated sunscreen; aromatherapy 
lotions for use in treating headaches, relieving stress, insomnia,” in International Class 005.Comparison of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
In the current case, applicant’s mark is “GIRL UNDISCOVERED WASH AWAY THE WILD 
GENTLE FACE CLEANSING GEL” and registrant’s marks are “GIRL UNDISCOVERED”. 
These marks are confusingly similar, because they both beginning with the wording “GIRL 
UNDISCOVERED”.  Consumers are likely to focus on this term in the marks, because consumers are 
generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or term in any trademark or service mark.  
See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 
73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between VEUVE ROYALE and two 
VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent feature’ as the first 
word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century 
Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding similarity between 
CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because “consumers must first notice th[e] 
identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 
1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial words is particularly significant 
because consumers typically notice those words first”).
 
Although applicant’s mark adds additional wording, that does not remove the similarity between the 
marks.  Adding a term to a registered mark generally neither obviates the similarity between the 
compared marks, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d).  See Coca-Cola 
Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106 (C.C.P.A. 1975) 
(holding BENGAL and BENGAL LANCER and design confusingly similar); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. 
Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1269 (TTAB 2009) (holding TITAN and VANTAGE TITAN confusingly 
similar); In re El Torito Rests., Inc., 9 USPQ2d 2002, 2004 (TTAB 1988) (holding MACHO and 
MACHO COMBOS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii).
 
Furthermore, even to the extent that potential purchasers may realize the apparent differences between 
the marks, they could still reasonably assume, due to the overall similarities in sound, appearance, 
connotation, and commercial impression in the respective marks, that applicant's goods sold under the 
“GIRL UNDISCOVERED WASH AWAY THE WILD GENTLE FACE CLEANSING GEL” 
mark constitute a new or additional product line from the same source as the goods and services sold 
under the “GIRL UNDISCOVERED” marks with which they are acquainted or familiar, or vice versa, 
and that applicant’s mark is merely a variation of the registrant’s mark.  See, e.g., SMS, Inc. v. Byn-
Mar Inc. 228 USPQ 219, 220 (TTAB 1985) (applicant’s marks ALSO ANDREA and ANDREA 
SPORT were “likely to evoke an association by consumers with opposer's preexisting mark [ANDREA 
SIMONE] for its established line of clothing.”).
 
In sum, because the marks share the confusingly similar wording “GIRL UNDISCOVERED”, and the 
other matter in the marks does not obviate the similarity between the marks, the marks are confusingly 
similar.Relatedness of the Goods and Services
 
The goods and services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or 
travel in the same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The goods and services of the parties need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000) 
(“[E]ven if the goods in question are different from, and thus not related to, one another in kind, the 
same goods can be related in the mind of the consuming public as to the origin of the goods.”); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). 
 
The respective goods and services need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing [be] such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 
1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 
1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); Gen. Mills Inc. v. Fage Dairy Processing Indus. SA, 100 USPQ2d 1584, 
1597 (TTAB 2011); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
In this case, applicant’s goods are “Cosmetics; non-medicated facial cleanser; non-medicated skin 
cleanser; cleansing bar; soap; makeup remover.” Registrant’s goods largely include medicated and non-
medicated preparations for the skin.  Applicant’s and registrant’s goods are confusingly similar, 
because they provide overlapping and related cosmetics and skin care preparations.
 
For example, in this case, the application uses broad wording to describe “cosmetics,” which 
presumably encompasses all goods of the type described, including registrant’s, narrower, “Non-
medicated preparations for the care, treatment and beautification of the skin.”  See, e.g., In re Solid 
State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 
USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally overlapping.  
See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, 
Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter 
IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay 
Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Registrant’s retail store services featuring “beauty products, cosmetics, cosmetic applicators and 
accessories” are also related to applicant’s beauty products and cosmetics, because the use of similar 
marks on or in connection with both products and retail-store services has been held likely to cause 
confusion where the evidence showed that the retail-store services featured the same type of products.  
See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding 
the use of similar marks for various clothing items, including athletic uniforms, and for retail shops 
featuring sports team related clothing and apparel likely to cause confusion); In re Country Oven, Inc., 
2019 USPQ2d 443903, at *12 (TTAB 2019) (holding the use of identical marks for bread buns and 
retail bakery stores and shops likely to cause confusion); In re House Beer, LLC, 114 USPQ2d 1073, 
1078 (TTAB 2015) (holding the use of identical marks for beer and for retail store services featuring 
beer likely to cause confusion); TMEP §1207.01(a)(ii).Furthermore, applicant’s and registrant’s cosmetics goods and services are related, because they are 
provided by the same entities in similar, channels of trade.  For example, the attached Internet evidence, 
consisting of online webpages from burtsbees.com, goldbond.com, dermae.com, and Neutrogena.com, 
establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant goods and 
markets the goods under the same mark.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are considered 
related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 
1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 
2009).
 
Because the marks are confusingly similar and because the marks refer to closely related and 
overlapping goods and services, consumers would be likely to mistakenly believe that the goods and 
services emanate from a single source. Accordingly, registration is refused under Trademark Section 
2(d).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusals by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  However, if applicant responds to the 
refusals, applicant must also respond to the requirements set forth below.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
 
The identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified according to the explanations and 
suggestions below.  See TMEP §1402.01.  The USPTO has the discretion to determine the degree of 
particularity needed to clearly identify goods covered by a mark.  In re Fiat Grp. Mktg. & Corp. 
Commc’ns S.p.A, 109 USPQ2d 1593, 1597 (TTAB 2014) (citing In re Omega SA, 494 F.3d 1362, 1365, 
83 USPQ2d 1541, 1543-44 (Fed. Cir. 2007)).  Accordingly, the USPTO requires the description of 
goods in a U.S. application to be specific, definite, clear, accurate, and concise.  TMEP §1402.01; see 
In re Fiat Grp. Mktg. & Corp. Commc’ns S.p.A, 109 USPQ2d at 1597-98; Cal. Spray-Chem. Corp. v. 
Osmose Wood Pres. Co. of Am., 102 USPQ 321, 322 (Comm’r Pats. 1954).  
 
The wording “cleansing bar” and “soap” in the identification of goods for International Class 003 must 
be clarified because it is too broad and could include goods in other international classes.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.  In particular, this wording could encompass cosmetics 
in International Class 003 or medicated preparations in International Class 005.
 
Applicant may adopt the following for its identification of goods, if accurate, providing additional 
specificity where indicated.
 
“Cosmetics; non-medicated facial cleanser; non-medicated skin cleanser; {Specify, e.g., 
“cosmetic”} cleansing bar {Specify type, e.g., “for the skin”}; {Specify, e.g., “cosmetic”} soap; 
makeup remover,” in International Class 003;
 
“{Specify, e.g., “Medicated”} cleansing bar {Specify type, e.g., “for the skin”}; {Specify, e.g., 
“Medicated”} soap,” in International Class 005.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods, but not to broaden or expand the 
goods beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06.  Generally, any deleted goods may not later be reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please seethe USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTICLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
 
If applicant amends the Identification of goods to include goods in additional classes, applicant must 
satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act Section 1(b):
 
(1)       List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)       Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fees already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods that are classified in 
at least two classes; however, applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only one class. Applicant 
must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or restrict the 
application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
DISCLAIMER
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “GENTLE FACE CLEANSING GEL” because it is merely 
descriptive of a feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 
2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from Collins Dictionary shows that the wording “GENTLE” refers to 
preparations that are “not severe, rough, or violent,” and the wording “GEL” is short for “a gelatinous 
preparation.”  Thus, the wording merely describes applicant’s goods, which include gelatinous 
preparations in the form of a “non-medicated facial cleanser” that is not rough on a user’s skin.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “GENTLE FACE CLEANSING GEL” apart 
from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire 
mark.  See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1041, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005); TMEP 
§1213.01(b).

Sarah J. SchneiderUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118826
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
