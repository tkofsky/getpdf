Summary of Issues 
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal – Merely Descriptive
Request for Information--Descriptive
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal – Merely Descriptive
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature and function of 
applicant’s services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 
1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services.  TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson 
LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 
1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of 
Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)). 
 
The applicant applied to register the mark DEVCYCLE for “software as a service (SAAS) services 
featuring software enabling developers and businesses to manage feature flags, experiments and 
personalization for development, deployment, and rollout of software code.” 
 
As demonstrated by the attached entry from the online Dictionary.com, the term DEV is an 
abbreviation for “software development."  See also the attached websites from Abbreviation Finder and 
Acronym24 defining "dev" to mean "development."  The attached Wikipedia article defines "software 
development" as "the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, 
testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other 
software components. Software development involves writing and maintaining the source code, but in a 
broader sense, it includes all processes from the conception of the desired software through to the final 
manifestation of the software, typically in a planned and structured process. Software development also 
includes research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or 
any other activities that result in software products."  The attached online Merriam-Webster 
dictionary defines CYCLE as "an interval of time during which a sequence of a recurring succession of 
events 
or 
phenomena 
is 
completed.”  
In 
addition, 
the 
attached 
third-party 
websites 
at https://medium.com/@jilvanpinheiro/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc-phases-
40d46afbe384 defines "cycle" regarding the life of a software, e.g., "software life cycle models 
describe phases of the software cycle and the order in which those phases are executed."  Moreover,applicant’s identification indicates software development services.  Therefore, DEV merely describes a 
function and CYCLE merely describes a feature of applicant’s services.
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods and/or services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not 
registrable.  In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re 
Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB (2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., Apollo 
Med. Extrusion Techs., Inc. v. Med. Extrusion Techs., Inc., 123 USPQ2d 1844, 1851 (TTAB 2017) 
(holding MEDICAL EXTRUSION TECHNOLOGIES merely descriptive of medical extrusion goods 
produced by employing medical extrusion technologies); In re Cannon Safe, Inc., 116 USPQ2d 1348, 
1351 (TTAB 2015) (holding SMART SERIES merely descriptive of metal gun safes); In re King Koil 
Licensing Co., 79 USPQ2d 1048, 1052 (TTAB 2006) (holding THE BREATHABLE MATTRESS 
merely descriptive of beds, mattresses, box springs, and pillows). 
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services is the combined mark 
registrable.  See In re Colonial Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In 
re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, DEVCYCLE immediately describes a feature and function of applicant’s services, i.e., 
software services to enable others in the development, deployment and rollout of software during its 
life or otherwise known as software development cycle and otherwise shortened to devcycle.  
Therefore, the combination of terms does not create a unique or incongruous meaning.   
 
For the above reasons, the proposed mark DEVCYCLE directly and immediately conveys information 
about applicant’s services.  Accordingly, the proposed mark is merely descriptive, and registration is 
properly refused on the Principal Register under section 2(e)(1).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Suggest Amendment to Supplemental Register
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register.  Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register.  See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816.  Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant 
from submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal(s).  TMEP §816.04.
 
Request for Information--Descriptive 
 
Due to the descriptive nature of the applied-for mark, applicant must provide the following information 
and documentation regarding the goods and/or services and wording appearing in the mark:
 
(1)        Fact sheets, instruction manuals, brochures, advertisements and pertinent 
screenshots of applicant’s website as it relates to the goods and/or services in the 
application, including any materials using the terms in the applied-for mark. Merely stating 
that information about the goods and/or services is available on applicant’s website is 
insufficient to make the information of record.;(2)        If these materials are unavailable, applicant should submit similar 
documentation for goods and services of the same type, explaining how its own product or 
services will differ. If the goods and/or services feature new technology and information 
regarding competing goods and/or services is not available, applicant must provide a 
detailed factual description of the goods and/or services. Factual information about the 
goods must make clear how they operate, salient features, and prospective customers and 
channels of trade. For services, the factual information must make clear what the services 
are and how they are rendered, salient features, and prospective customers and channels of 
trade. Conclusory statements will not satisfy this requirement.; and
 
(3)        Applicant must respond to the following questions: services; e.g., Do 
applicant’s services involve software development cycles? Do applicant’s competitors use 
DEV CYCLE or DEV or CYCLE to advertise similar goods and services? Who is the 
typical consumer of applicant’s goods and/or services? Where are applicant’s goods and/or 
services typically purchased and/or provided?
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§814, 1402.01(e).
 
If applicant submits webpage evidence to satisfy this requirement, applicant must provide (1) an image 
of the webpage, (2) the date it was accessed or printed, and (3) the complete URL address. In re ADCO 
Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 
1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018)); TMEP §710.01(b). Providing only a website address or hyperlink to the 
webpage is not sufficient to make the materials of record. In re ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 
USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (citing In re Olin Corp., 124 USPQ2d 1327, 1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB 
Solomon Assocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); TBMP §1208.03); TMEP §814.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
