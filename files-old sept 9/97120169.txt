Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Section 2(e)(2) - Geographically Descriptive Refusal 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is primarily geographically descriptive of the 
origin of applicant’s goods. Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); see TMEP §§1210, 
1210.01(a).
 
A mark is primarily geographically descriptive when the following is demonstrated:
 
(1)        The primary significance of the mark to the purchasing public is a generally 
known location;
 
(2)        The goods or services originate in the place identified in the mark; and
 
(3)        The purchasing public would be likely to believe that the goods or services 
originate in the geographic place identified in the mark; that is, to make a goods-place or 
services-place association.
 
See Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *5 (TTAB 2020) (citing 
In re Nantucket, Inc., 677 F.2d 95, 96-97, 213 USPQ 889, 891 (C.C.P.A. 1982)); see also In re 
Newbridge Cutlery Co., 776 F.3d 854, 860-61, 113 USPQ2d 1445, 1448-49 (Fed. Cir. 2015); In re 
Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1452 (Fed. 
Cir. 1987); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 (TTAB 2001)); TMEP §1210.01(a).
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark LONGWOOD TRUCK CENTER for use in connection with“trucks” in Class 12.   
 
First, the primary significance of LONGWOOD is a geographic location, namely, a town in Florida. 
See attachments from Wikipedia, the Crazy Tourist, LongwoodFl.org, Longwood Florida Historical 
Society, Niche.com, and Trip Advisor showing the geographic significance of LONGWOOD.  
 
Second, the record indicates that applicant's goods originate in LONGWOOD because applicant's 
address is near LONGWOOD in Sanford, Florida, approximately four and a half miles away. See 
evidence from Google Maps.  
 
A product that is produced or a service that is provided near the geographic place named in the applied-
for mark is sufficient to support a finding that the goods and/or services originate in that geographic 
location. See, e.g., City of London Distillery, Ltd. v. Hayman Grp. Ltd., 2020 USPQ2d 11487, at *9-10 
(TTAB 2020) (holding CITY OF LONDON primarily geographically descriptive of gin distilled within 
and bottled near the city limits of London); In re Spirits of New Merced, LLC, 85 USPQ2d 1614, 1621 
(TTAB 2007) (holding YOSEMITE BEER primarily geographically descriptive of beer produced and 
sold in Merced, California, a city located 80 miles from Yosemite National Park, where the goods 
originated in an area “located near YOSEMITE”); In re Joint-Stock Co. "Baik," 80 USPQ2d 1305, 
1310-11 (TTAB 2006) (holding BAIKALSKAYA, the Russian equivalent of “from Baikal” or 
“Baikal’s,” primarily geographically descriptive of vodka where applicant was located near Lake 
Baikal, and applicant did not dispute that it produced vodka from a location near and used water from 
Lake Baikal).
 
The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has stated that the purpose of Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2) is 
“to leave geographic names free for all businesses operating in the same area to inform customers 
where their goods or services originate.” In re Spirits of New Merced, 85 USPQ2d at 1621 (citing In re 
MCO Props. Inc., 38 USPQ2d 1154, 1156 (TTAB 1995)).
 
Remoteness or obscurity of a geographic location is determined not in the abstract, but from the point 
of view of the average American consumer of the particular goods and/or services. TMEP §1210.04(c); 
see, e.g., In re Joint-Stock Co. “Baik,” 80 USPQ2d 1305, 1309-10 (TTAB 2006) (holding that the 
relevant American consumer, purchasers of vodka, including Russian vodka, would likely know the 
geographic significance of the mark because they are most likely either from Russia, have Russian 
relatives, or became familiar with Russia when learning the language); In re MCO Props. Inc., 38 
USPQ2d 1154, 1155-56 (TTAB 1995) (holding FOUNTAIN HILLS primarily geographically 
descriptive of real estate development services rendered in Fountain Hills, Arizona, population 10,030, 
because the record showed Fountain Hills to be the name of the town where applicant was located and 
rendered its services, and relevant American consumers in the real estate market who came into contact 
with applicant’s promotional brochure specimen would associate the place with the services).
 
Here, Longwood, Florida, is where applicant provides its goods and the relevant American consumers 
in the truck market who come into contact with applicant's mark will associate the place, Longwood, 
with the goods.  
 
Finally, a goods-place or services-place association may be presumed where (1) the location in the 
mark is generally known to the purchasing public, (2) the term’s geographical significance is its 
primary significance, and (3) the goods and/or services do, in fact, originate from the named location in 
the mark. TMEP §1210.04; see, e.g., In re Cal. Pizza Kitchen Inc., 10 USPQ2d 1704, 1705 (TTAB 
1988) (finding a services-place association was presumed between applicant’s restaurant services andCalifornia because the services originated in California); In re Handler Fenton Ws., Inc., 214 USPQ 
848, 850 (TTAB 1982) (finding a goods-place association was presumed between applicant’s t-shirts 
and Denver because the goods had their geographical origin in Denver); see also In re Nantucket, Inc., 
677 F.2d 95, 102, 213 USPQ 889, 895 (C.C.P.A. 1982) (Nies, J., concurring) (“[W]e must start with the 
concept that a geographic name of a place of business is a descriptive term when used on the goods of 
that business. There is a public goods/place association, in effect, presumed.” (internal footnote 
removed)).
 
Here because the primary significance of LONGWOOD is to identify a geographic location and 
applicant’s goods originate in this place, purchasers will presume that LONGWOOD identifies the 
place from which the goods originate. Thus, the term LONGWOOD, is primarily geographically 
descriptive of the origin of applicant's goods. 
 
Although, the applied-for mark also includes the terms TRUCK CENTER, this does not change the 
overall geographic significance of the marks.  
 
The addition of generic or highly descriptive wording to a geographic word or term does not diminish 
that geographic word or term’s primary geographic significance. TMEP §1210.02(c)(ii); see, e.g., 
Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *6-7 (TTAB 2020) (holding 
CHARLESTON HARBOR TOURS primarily geographically descriptive of various travel tour and 
cruise services because TOURS is generic for the services and CHARLESTON HARBOR is a well-
known harbor in Charleston, South Carolina); In re Hollywood Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 1852, 
1853-54 (TTAB 2014) (holding HOLLYWOOD LAWYERS ONLINE primarily geographically 
descriptive of attorney referrals, online business information, and an online business directory).
 
In this case, the terms TRUCK CENTER are highly descriptive as applied to applicant's goods. 
The attached evidence from Merriam-Webster shows TRUCK, means "an automotive vehicle with a 
short chassis equipped with a swivel for attaching a trailer and used especially for the highway hauling 
of freight" and CENTER, means "a facility providing a place for a particular activity or service." 
The applicant's goods are trucks, as evidenced by the identification of goods, and center describes a 
characteristic of the goods, i.e. where the goods are sold.  Thus, TRUCK CENTER does not diminish 
the overall geographic significance of the composite mark. 
 
Ultimately, when purchasers encounter the applied-for mark in the marketplace, they will immediately 
understand the mark as identifying the geographic origin of applicant’s goods, and not an indication 
that applicant is the source of the goods. Therefore, the mark is primarily geographically descriptive of 
the origin of applicant’s goods, and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(e)(2) of the Trademark 
Act.   
 
Advisory regarding Amendment to the Supplemental Register to Overcome Refusal 
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register. Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816. Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant 
from submitting evidence and arguments against the refusals. TMEP §816.04.
 
Although registration on the Supplemental Register does not afford all the benefits of registration on 
the Principal Register, it does provide the following advantages to the registrant:(1)       Use of the registration symbol ® with the registered mark in connection with 
the designated goods and/or services, which provides public notice of the registration and 
potentially deters third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(2)       Inclusion of the registered mark in the USPTO’s database of registered and 
pending marks, which will (a) make it easier for third parties to find it in trademark search 
reports, (b) provide public notice of the registration, and thus (c) potentially deter third 
parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(3)       Use of the registration by a USPTO trademark examining attorney as a bar to 
registering confusingly similar marks in applications filed by third parties.
 
(4)       Use of the registration as a basis to bring suit for trademark infringement in 
federal court, which, although more costly than state court, means judges with more 
trademark experience, often faster adjudications, and the opportunity to seek an injunction, 
actual damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
(5)       Use of the registration as a filing basis for a trademark application for 
registration in certain foreign countries, in accordance with international treaties.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(d), 1091, 1094; J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair 
Competition §§19:33, 19:37 (rev. 4th ed. Supp. 2017).
 
Advisory regarding Disclaimer of Generic Wording if Amending to the Supplemental Register
 
Applicant is advised that, if the application is amended to seek registration on the Principal Register 
under Trademark Act Section 2(f) or on the Supplemental Register, applicant will be required to 
disclaim “TRUCK CENTER” because such wording appears to be generic in the context of applicant’s 
goods and/or services. See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Wella Corp., 565 F.2d 143, 144, 196 USPQ 7, 8 
(C.C.P.A. 1977); In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 USPQ 766, 768 (TTAB 1986); TMEP 
§1213.03(b).
 
Applicant may submit a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “TRUCK CENTER” apart from the mark 
as shown.
 
TMEP §1213.08(a)(i).
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
 
Specimen-Refusal
 
Specimen does not show use of the mark in commerce. Registration is refused because the specimen 
does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in International Class 012. 
Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP 
§§904, 904.07(a). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimenshowing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods 
identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Specifically, the submitted specimen is not an acceptable point-of-sale display showing the mark 
directly associated with the goods, trucks, because the information necessary for the ordering the 
goods, trucks, is not provided.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c).  Any webpage 
printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was 
accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a 
verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in 
commerce for the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following 
statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. 
§2.20: “The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) 
was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or 
prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be 
accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
