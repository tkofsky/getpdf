DECLARATION: The signatory being warned that willful false statements and the like are punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both,
under 18 U.S.C. § 1001, and that such willful false statements and the like may jeopardize the validity of the application or submission or
any registration resulting therefrom, declares that, if the applicant submitted the application or allegation of use (AOU) unsigned, all
statements in the application or AOU and this submission based on the signatory's own knowledge are true, and all statements in the
application or AOU and this submission made on information and belief are believed to be true.
STATEMENTS FOR UNSIGNED SECTION 1(a) APPLICATION/AOU: If the applicant filed an unsigned application under 15 U.S.C.
§1051(a) or AOU under 15 U.S.C. §1051(c), the signatory additionally believes that: the applicant is the owner of the mark sought to be
registered; the mark is in use in commerce and was in use in commerce as of the filing date of the application or AOU on or in connection with
the goods/services/collective membership organization in the application or AOU; the original specimen(s), if applicable, shows the mark in use
in commerce as of the filing date of the application or AOU on or in connection with the goods/services/collective membership organization in

COLLECTIVE/CERTIFICATION MARK APPLICATION: If the applicant filed an unsigned application under 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051(b),

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issues below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
DATABASE SEARCHThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Amended Identification of Services Required
•
Multiple Class Application Requirements
•
 
 
AMENDED IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES REQUIRED
 
The identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because the exact nature of the services 
is not clear and could include services in multiple classes. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. 
Applicant must amend the identification to specify the common commercial or generic name of the 
services and classify the services correctly. See TMEP §1402.01. If the services have no common 
commercial or generic name, applicant must describe or explain the nature of the services using clear 
and succinct language. See id.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:
 
Class 035: Business Consulting service in the field of environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
standards
 
Class 036: Financial  Consulting service in the field of environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
standards
 
Class 042: Consulting service in the field of environmental science
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand the 
services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Applicant should also note the following additional requirement. 
 
 
MULTIPLE CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
 
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee already paid (view 
the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that are 
classified in at least three classes; however, applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only one 
class.  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted 
fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.

ability to timely respond.
•
Responses signed by an unauthorized party are not accepted and can cause the application to

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119746
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
