NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Likelihood of Confusion Refusal
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 6100682.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registration. 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that so resembles a registered mark 
that it is likely a consumer would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the source of the goods 
and/or services of the applicant and registrant(s).  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Determining likelihood of 
confusion is made on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de 
Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973).  In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 
866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  However, “[n]ot all of the [du Pont] 
factors are relevant to every case, and only factors of significance to the particular mark need be 
considered.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1366, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 
1719 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601. F.3d 1342, 1346, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1259 
(Fed. Cir 2010)).
 
The USPTO may focus its analysis “on dispositive factors, such as similarity of the marks and 
relatedness of the goods [and/or services].”  In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 
1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 
1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); see TMEP §1207.01.
 
Comparison of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014) (citing In re 1st USA Realty 
Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007)); In re White Swan Ltd., 8 USPQ2d 1534, 1535 
(TTAB 1988)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
‘whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression’ such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.”  In 
re U.S. Warriors Ice Hockey Program, Inc., 122 USPQ2d 1790, 1795 (TTAB 2017) (citing Coach 
Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b).  The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks.  In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 
USPQ2d 1958, 1960 (TTAB 2016) (citing Spoons Rests. Inc. v. Morrison Inc., 23 USPQ2d 1735, 1741 
(TTAB 1991), aff’d per curiam, 972 F.2d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1992)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Further, the marks “must be considered … in light of the fallibility of memory ….”In re St. Helena 
Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 2014)(quotation omitted). We focus on therecollection of the average consumers – here, ordinary consumers of beach and swim related items – 
who would normally retain a general rather than a specific impression of trademarks. See id. at 1085; 
Geigy Chem. Corp.v. Atlas Chem. Indus., Inc., 438 F.2d 1005, 169 USPQ 39, 40 (CCPA 1971).  
 
 
The marks in this case are identical. 
 
Applicant's mark(s) is/are in standard characters.  A mark in typed or standard characters may be 
displayed in any lettering style; the rights reside in the wording or other literal element and not in any 
particular display or rendition. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 
(Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 
37 C.F.R. §2.52(a); TMEP §1207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a mark presented in stylized characters and/or with a 
design element generally will not avoid likelihood of confusion with a mark in typed or standard 
characters because the word portion could be presented in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re 
Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 
216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that “the argument concerning a difference in type style is 
not viable where one party asserts rights in no particular display”).   Both marks can visually be 
depicted in the same font or stylization, making them alike or similar in appearance. 
 
Thus for the reasons stated above, the marks would be considered similar within the meaning of 
Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act because of the similarity in appearance and commercial impression.
 
Comparison of the goods
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int'l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi). 
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be "related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source." Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). 
 
Registrant's goods are: Bathtub toys; Beach balls; Floating recreational lounge chairs; Floats for 
bathing and swimming; Infant development toys; Infant toys; Inflatable float mattresses or pads 
for recreational use; Inflatable pool toys; Inflatable pools for recreational use; Inflatable ride-on 
toys; Inflatable swimming pools; Inflatable toys; Pet toys; Play mats containing infant toys; Play 
swimming pools; Swimming belts; Swimming floats; Swimming jackets; Swimming rings; Water 
toys 
 
Applicant's goods are:  International Class 009: Breathing apparatus for underwater swimming; 
Cases for eyewear; Contact lenses; Divers' masks; Downloadable computer game software; 
Downloadable computer operating programs; Eye glasses; Goggles for sports; Life jackets; Recorded 
computer operating softwareThe parties' goods are  related as shown by the bolding of the relevant wording above.  The 
identified goods are related because they are for swimming, as indicated by the mark.  The 
goods would be marketed to the same users in the same channel of trade. 
 
The trademark examining attorney supplies the attached marketplace evidence which establishes that 
the relevant goods and/or services are sold or provided through the same trade channels and used by the 
same classes of consumers in the same fields of use.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or 
services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty 
Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 
1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009). 
 
Finally, the goods and/or services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of 
trade, or classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same 
class of purchasers.” In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
Thus for the reasons stated above, the goods would be considered related within the meaning of Section 
2(d) of the Trademark Act.  
 
In sum, the crucial factors supporting the finding of confusion exist here.  The factors are that the 
parties' goods bear similar marks and that these goods are the types that are offered by the same entities 
to the same consumers in the same channel of trade.  These factors give rise to the consumers' 
likelihood of confusion as to the source of the goods. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Response guidelines
 
Applicant should include the following information on all correspondence with the Office: (1) the name

may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
