System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues
 
Section 2(d) Refusal – Likelihood of Confusion 
•
 
Section 2(d) Refusal – Likelihood of Confusion 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 5060180. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.  
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-
by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 
1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 
F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those 
factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in 
every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) 
(quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). 
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 1747 
(quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1380 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 
24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the cumulative 
effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods and differences in the marks.”); TMEP 
§1207.01.
 
Applicant’s applied-for mark is WICKED SISTERS in standard characters for “Blush; Eyeliner; 
Foundation; Lipstick; Mascara; Perfume; Eyebrow pencils; Eyeshadow palettes; False eyelashes; Lip 
liner; Loose face powder; Pomades for eyebrows for cosmetic purposes; Pressed face powder; Facial 
concealer; Non-medicated serums for use on face” in International Class 3. 
 
Registrant’s mark is WICKED SISTA in standard characters for “Cosmetic, make-up and toiletry bags 
and cases, sold empty; purses including change purses; wash bags for carrying toiletries; holdalls; 
traveling bags” in International Class 18.
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot PonsardinMaison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
The applied-for WICKED SISTERS and registered WICKED SISTA marks are confusingly similar 
because the marks share the wording WICKED as the dominant, lead term. Consumers are generally 
more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any trademark or service mark. See Palm 
Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 
USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE 
CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the 
mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 
970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding similarity between CENTURY 21 
and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because “consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead 
word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 
2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial words is particularly significant because 
consumers typically notice those words first”).
 
In addition, the marks are identical in impression because the additional wording SISTERS and SISTA 
in the compared marks reference a female sibling. See attached evidence from the Merriam-Webster 
Dictionary and The Online Slang Dictionary. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the applicant’s applied-for and registrant’s marks are sufficiently similar to 
find a likelihood of confusion.
 
Relatedness of the Goods
 
The goods are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods] emanate from 
the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 
1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 
2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of website excerpts from Kyle, Rare Beauty, Charlotte 
Tilbury, Sephora, Kate Spade, and Dior establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, 
produces, or provides the relevant goods and markets the goods under the same mark.  See, e.g., In re 
Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 
USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009). Specifically, the attached evidence demonstrates the 
following:Kylie provides blush, eyeliner, lipstick, eyebrow pencils, false eyelashes, lip liner, face powder, 
serums for use on face (applicant's goods), and cosmetic and make-up bags (registrant's goods). 
•
Rare Beauty provides blush, foundation, lipstick, mascara, eyebrow pencils, eye shadow palettes, 
lip liner, face powder, concealer (applicant's goods), and cosmetic and make-up bags (registrant's 
goods). 
•
Charlotte Tilbury provides blush, eyeliner, foundation, lipstick, mascara, eyebrow pencils, eye 
shadow palettes, lip liner, face powder, concealer, serums for use on face (applicant's goods), and 
cosmetic and make-up bags (registrant's goods). 
•
Sephora provides blush, eyeliner, foundation, lipstick, mascara, eyebrow pencils, eye shadow 
palettes, false eyelashes, lip liner, face powder, concealer, face serums (applicant's goods), and 
cosmetic and make-up bags (registrant's goods). 
•
Kate Spade provides perfume (applicant's goods) and cosmetic and make-up bags (registrant's 
goods). 
•
Dior provides perfume, face serum (applicant's goods), and cosmetic and make-up bags 
(registrant's goods).
•
 
Based on the analysis above, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are related.
 
Because applicant’s and registrant’s marks are similar and the goods are related, there is a likelihood of 
confusion and applicant’s applied-for mark must be refused under Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
