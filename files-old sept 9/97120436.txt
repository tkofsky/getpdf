NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKSThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Identification and Classification of Goods 
 
The identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified to further specify the nature of the goods. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must amend the identification to specify the 
common commercial or generic name of the goods. See TMEP §1402.01. If the goods have no common 
commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the product, its main purpose, and its intended 
uses. See id. 
 
Applicant has classified “clothing” in International Class 003; however, the proper classification is 
International Class 025. Therefore, applicant may respond by (1) adding International Class 025 to the 
application and reclassifying these goods in the proper international class, (2) deleting “clothing” from 
the application, or (3) deleting the remainder of the items in the identification and reclassifying the 
specified goods in the proper international class. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.86(a), 6.1; TMEP §§1403.02 et seq. 
If applicant adds one or more international classes to the application, applicant must comply with the 
multiple-class requirements specified in this Office action.
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “accessories” because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make clear what 
the goods are. Further, this wording could identify goods in more than one international class. See 
examples of proper classification below. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 003: Skincare products, NAMELY, ____ (SPECIFY CLASS 003 ITEMS, e.g., NON-MEDICATED 
SKIN CARE PREPARATIONS); Beauty Products, NAMELY, ____ (SPECIFY CLASS 003 ITEMS, e.g., 
BEAUTY CARE COSMETICS, NON-MEDICATED BEAUTY SOAP); Petcare Products, NAMELY, 
____ (SPECIFY CLASS 003 ITEMS, e.g., NON-MEDICATED GROOMING PREPARATIONS FOR 
PETS); Aromatherapy Products, NAMELY, ____ (SPECIFY CLASS 003 ITEMS, e.g., NON-
MEDICATED SKIN CREAMS WITH ESSENTIAL OILS FOR USE IN AROMATHERAPY); Home 
Aromatherapy, NAMELY, ____ (SPECIFY CLASS 003 ITEMS, e.g., AROMATHERAPY SPRAYS 
COMPRISED OF ESSENTIAL OILS, INCENSE); Household Cleaning Products, NAMELY, ____ 
(SPECIFY CLASS 003 ITEMS, e.g., CLEANING PREPARATIONS); Hair Care Products, NAMELY, 
____ (SPECIFY CLASS 003 ITEMS, e.g., HAIR CARE PREPARATIONS); Natural Fragrances 
 
Class 014: ACCESSORIES, NAMELY, _____ (SPECIFY CLASS 014 ACCESSORIES, e.g., JEWELRY, 
WATCHES)
 
Class 018: ACCESSORIES, NAMELY, _____ (SPECIFY CLASS 018 ACCESSORIES, e.g., 
HANDBAGS, WALLETS, DUFFEL BAGS)
 
Class 025: CLOTHING, NAMELY, ____ (SPECIFY PARTICULAR ITEMS OF CLOTHING, e.g., 
PANTS, SHIRTS, JACKETS, HATS)
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Requirements for Combined Applications – 1(a) 
 
The application references goods based on use in commerce in more than one international class; 
therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) 
already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods abased on use in commerce that are classified in at least 4 classes; 
however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 class. Applicant must either (a) 
submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) restrict the 
application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for class 003; and applicant needs a specimen for classes014, 018 and 025. See 
more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce 
on or in connection with the goods listed in the application at least as early as the 
filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).

on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120436
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.

Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
