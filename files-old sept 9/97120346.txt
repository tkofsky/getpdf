below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Likelihood of confusion refusal
 
•
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 5551059 and 6407755.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registrations. 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”).  In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.”  In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis:  (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services.  See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d)goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.  
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or 
services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer.  See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
 Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the 
registrant.  TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
The applicant’s mark is EPIC HEALTH & FITNESS for fitness instruction services.  
 
The registrants' marks are:
 
    1.  EPICFIT 365 (Reg. No. 5551059 Owner IAF Systems) for clothing and fitness instruction 
services;
   2. EPIC FITNESS (Reg. No. 6407755 Owner Argos Enterprise, LLC) for weight lifting equipment 
and online store services featuring weight lifting equipment. 
 
The marks are similar in this case.  Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a 
mark may be more significant or dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 
671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 
1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter 
that is descriptive of or generic for a party’s goods and/or services is typically less significant or less 
dominant when comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 
1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).  The applicant and the registrant of EPIC FITNESS 
have disclaimed HEALTH & FITNESS and FITNESS.  In addition, if EPICFIT was in two words, FIT 
would have been required to be disclaimed because FIT is the shortened version of FITNESS.
 
EPIC is the salient feature of the marks, and is identical in the three marks.  Marks may be confusingly 
similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the 
compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 
USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly 
similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and 
CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-
(iii).  Consumers are likely to be confused as to the source of the goods/services when they encounter 
the goods/services bearing the marks because they are likely to believe that the goods/services emanate 
from the same source.  The marks are highly similar.
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The goods/services are identical and related in this case.  The applicant and the owner of EPICFIT 365 
both provide fitness services.  Where the goods and/or services of an applicant and registrant are 
identical or virtually identical, the degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding 
that confusion is likely declines. See Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 
1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 
(Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b).  
 
In addition, fitness services and weight lifting equipment emanate from the same sources.  The 
trademark examining attorney has attached evidence from the USPTO’s X-Search database consisting 
of a number of third-party marks registered/applications for use in connection with the same or similar 
goods and/or services as those of both applicant and registrant in this case.  This evidence shows that 
the goods and/or services listed therein are of a kind that may emanate from a single source under a 
single mark.  See In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 1730, 1737 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Infinity Broad. 
Corp., 60 USPQ2d 1214, 1217-18 (TTAB 2001); In re Albert Trostel & Sons Co., 29 USPQ2d 1783, 
1785-86 (TTAB 1993); In re Mucky Duck Mustard Co., 6 USPQ2d 1467, 1470 n.6 (TTAB 1988)); 
TMEP §1207.01(d)(iii).
 
In addition, the attached Internet evidence, consisting of excerpted representative articles from the 
internet, establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant 
goods and/or services, markets the goods and/or services under the same mark, and the relevant goods 
and/or services are sold or provided through the same trade channels and used by the same classes of 
consumers in the same fields of use.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are 
considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 
USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 
1271-72 (TTAB 2009).  The same consumers would encounter both goods and services and are likely 
to be confused as to the source of the goods/services.
 
Please note any differences in the goods and/or services of the parties is not controlling in determining 
likelihood of confusion. The issue is not likelihood of confusion between particular goods and/or 
services, but likelihood of confusion as to the source or sponsorship of those goods and/or services. 
In re Majestic Distilling Co., 315 F.3d 1311, 1316, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1205 (Fed. Cir. 2003); In re Shell 
Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 1993); TMEP §1207.01. 
 
The goods/services travel in the same channels of trade.  Or, the conditions surrounding their marketing 
may be such, that they could be encountered by the same purchasers under circumstances that could 
give rise to the mistaken belief that the goods/services come from a common source.
 
The similarities among the mark and the goods/services of the parties are so great as to create a 
likelihood of confusion.Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120346
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
