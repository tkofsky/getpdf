Issue date:  August 24, 2022
Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues
 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusal 
•
Advisory regarding Potential Section 2(d) Refusal - Prior-Filed Application
•
 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusal 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 6465048. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark MINGO CREEK in standard characters for “Bourbon; 
Whisky; Bourbon whisky; Whiskey” in International Class 33.
 
Registrant’s mark is MINGO in standard characters for “Alcoholic beverages containing fruit;Alcoholic beverages, except beer; Alcoholic fruit cocktail drinks; Prepared alcoholic cocktail.” in 
International Class 33. 
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Here, applicant’s mark, MINGO CREEK, is confusingly similar to the registered mark, MINGO. 
 
Both marks begin with the identical, dominant wording MINGO and thus create a confusingly similar 
commercial impression despite applicant's inclusion of the additional wording CREEK.
 
Adding a term to a registered mark generally does not obviate the similarity between the compared 
marks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d). See 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106 
(C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL and BENGAL LANCER and design confusingly similar); In re 
Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1269 (TTAB 2009) (holding TITAN and VANTAGE 
TITAN confusingly similar); In re El Torito Rests., Inc., 9 USPQ2d 2002, 2004 (TTAB 1988) (holding 
MACHO and MACHO COMBOS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii).
 
In the present case, the marks are identical in part with  respect to the dominant wording MINGO and 
thus are likely to create confusingly similar commercial impressions in the minds of consumers.
 
Moreover, consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any 
trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 
1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between 
VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a 
‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 
Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) 
(finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because 
“consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial 
words is particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”).
 
Here, applicant's inclusion of the additional wording CREEK does not obviate the similarities between 
the marks because the overall commercial impression created by use of identical dominant wording in 
both applicant’s and registrant’s marks is likely to lead to confusion as to the source of the goods. In 
other words, consumers encountering these marks are likely to mistakenly believe that the common 
wording identifies a common source for the goods.
 
Accordingly, because the marks look and sound similar and create the same commercial impression, 
the marks are considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.Relatedness of the Goods 
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods stated in the application 
and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 
F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 
1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the registration uses broad wording to describe "Alcoholic beverages, except beer", which 
presumably encompasses all goods of the type described, including applicant’s more narrow "Bourbon; 
Whisky; Bourbon whisky; Whiskey".  See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-
15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, 
applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally in this regard.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 
USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 
F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 
USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 
1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
Further, applicant’s goods, “Bourbon; Whisky; Bourbon whisky; Whiskey,” are closely related to 
registrant’s remaining goods, “Alcoholic beverages containing fruit; Alcoholic fruit cocktail drinks; 
Prepared alcoholic cocktail.” 
 
Various alcoholic beverages have been shown to be related goods for purposes of a Trademark Act 
Section 2(d) analysis. In re Chatam Int’l Inc., 380 F.3d 1340, 71 USPQ2d 1944 (Fed. Cir. 2004) 
(holding GASPAR’S ALE for beer and ale likely to be confused with JOSE GASPAR GOLD for 
tequila); In re Majestic Distilling Co., 315 F.3d 1311, 65 USPQ2d 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (holding RED 
BULL for tequila likely to be confused with RED BULL for malt liquor); In re Kysela Pere et Fils Ltd., 
98 USPQ2d 1261 (TTAB 2011) (holding HB for wine likely to be confused with HB and design for 
beer); Somerset Distilling, Inc. v. Speymalt Whiskey Distribs. Ltd., 14 USPQ2d 1539 (TTAB 1989) 
(holding JAS. GORDON and design for scotch whiskey likely to be confused with GORDON’S for 
distilled gin and vodka); Schieffelin & Co. v. Molson Cos., 9 USPQ2d 2069 (TTAB 1989) (holding 
BRAS D’OR for brandy likely to be confused with BRADOR for beer); Bureau Nat’l 
Interprofessionnel Du Cognac v. Int’l Better Drinks Corp., 6 USPQ2d 1610 (TTAB 1988) (holding 
trademark COLAGNAC for cola flavored liqueur likely to be confused with certification mark 
COGNAC for brandy).
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots from Cutwater, High West Distillery, and 
Dogfish Head establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the 
relevant goods and markets the goods under the same mark. Additionally, this evidence demonstrates 
that the relevant goods travel in the same channels of trade and are purchased by the same class of 
consumers. Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are considered related for likelihood of confusion 
purposes. See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re 
Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).Accordingly, the goods are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of confusion analysis. 
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods are related, there is a likelihood of confusion as to the 
source of applicant’s goods and/or services, and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(d) of the 
Trademark Act.
 
Advisory regarding Potential Section 2(d) Refusal - Prior-Filed Application 
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 97115375 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
While applicant is not required to respond to the issue of the pending application, applicant must 
respond to the Section 2(d) Refusal above within the six month deadline mentioned above to avoid 
abandonment.
 
Response Options to Refusals 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. 
 
Response Guidelines
 
For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal and/or requirement in this 
Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and evidence against the refusal, 
and may have other response options if specified above. For a requirement, applicant should set forth 
the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office Actions” and the informational video 
“Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on responding.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191;
