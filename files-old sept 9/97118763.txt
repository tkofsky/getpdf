NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
Summary of Issues:  The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark 
examining attorney.  Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. 
§1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Section 2(d) Refusal – Likelihood of Confusion
•
Disclaimer Required – "CHEF'S"
•
 
 
I.    SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 1968704.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registration.
 
The Marks
 
The applied-for mark is CHEF'S UNIQUE, in standard characters, for “Bowls; Dinnerware; Plates; 
Basting brushes; Cheese boards; Hand-operated grinders; Household utensils, namely, turners; 
Household utensils, namely, kitchen tongs; Household utensils, namely, spatulas; Ice cream scoops; 
Kitchen ladles; Napkin holders; Oven mitts; Slotted spoons; Spice racks; Trays for household purposes; 
Whisks; Hand-operated pepper grinders; Hand-operated spice grinders” in International Class 21.
 
UNIQUE, in standard characters, for in relevant part “plastic beverage stirrers, plastic cups, plastic 
candle holders, paper plates, paper cups, candy cups” in International Class 21. 
 
Likelihood of Confusion Analysis
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registeredmark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the parties’ goods and/or services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Likelihood of confusion is determined 
on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 
F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”).  In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Any evidence of 
record related to those factors is considered, however “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of 
similar weight in every case.”  In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 
(Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. 
Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis:  (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services.  See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.  Each of these factors is addressed in the sections below.
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
The applied-for mark CHEF'S UNIQUE is confusingly similar to the registered mark UNIQUE, which 
weighs in favor of a likelihood of confusion.
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.”  
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b).  The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks.  In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 
(TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP 
§1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 
2014).
 
The applied-for mark CHEF'S UNIQUE is similar to the registered mark UNIQUE because they both 
contain or comprise the identical term UNIQUE.  The applied-for mark differs from the registered mark 
in that it adds the term CHEF'S, however adding a term to a registered mark generally does not obviate 
the similarity between the compared marks, or overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d).See Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106 
(C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL and BENGAL LANCER and design confusingly similar); In re 
Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1269 (TTAB 2009) (holding TITAN and VANTAGE 
TITAN confusingly similar); In re El Torito Rests., Inc., 9 USPQ2d 2002, 2004 (TTAB 1988) (holding 
MACHO and MACHO COMBOS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii). In the present case, 
the marks are identical in part. The marks in this case are identical in-part.
 
The addition of CHEF'S to the applied-for mark also fails to significantly distinguish it from the 
registered mark in this case, because the shared term UNIQUE is the dominant portion of the applied-
for mark.  The shared term UNIQUE is the dominant portion of the applied-for mark, because the term 
CHEF'S merely describes applicant's goods.  MarksAlthough marks are compared in their entireties,  
however one feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in creating a commercial 
impression. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 
2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); 
TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Matter that is descriptive of or generic for a party’s goods and/or 
services is typically less significant or less dominant in relation to other wording in a mark. See 
Anheuser-Busch, LLC v. Innvopak Sys. Pty Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1816, 1824-25 (TTAB 2015) (citing In 
re Chatam Int’l Inc., 380 F.3d 1340, 1342-43, 71 USPQ2d 1944, 1946 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  The attached 
evidence from the American Heritage dictionary shows that a "chef" is "a cook, especially the chief 
cook of a large kitchen staff."  Applicant's goods in this case include various kitchen items, e.g. 
"Bowls; Dinnerware; Plates; Basting brushes; Cheese boards; Hand-operated grinders; Household 
utensils, namely, turners; Household utensils, namely, kitchen tongs; Household utensils, namely, 
spatulas; Ice cream scoops; Kitchen ladles; Napkin holders; Oven mitts; Slotted spoons; Spice racks; 
Trays for household purposes; Whisks; Hand-operated pepper grinders; Hand-operated spice grinders", 
which presumably encompass all goods of those kinds, including such goods used by, or intended for 
use by, a chef.  The term "CHEF'S" in the applied-for mark therefore merely describes an intended user 
of applicant's goods, and is less significant to the mark's overall commercial impression than the shared 
term UNIQUE.
 
The marks CHEF'S UNIQUE and UNIQUE are similar, and consumers who encounter the marks used 
in connection with similar or related goods and/or services are likely to be confused as to the source of 
those goods. 
 
Relatedness of the Goods
 
Applicant’s goods are related to registrant’s goods, which weighs in favor of a likelihood of confusion.
 
Goods are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the same 
trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).  Likelihood of confusion is 
based on the description of the goods stated in the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic 
evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 
(Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. 
Cir. 2017)).  
 
Applicant’s goods are related to registrant’s goods because they partially overlap.  The application in 
this case uses broad wording to describe “dinnerware" and "plates”, which presumably encompasses all 
goods of those types, including registrant's narrower “plastic cups", "paper plates", and "paper cups.”See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. 
Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Applicant’s and registrant’s overlapping 
goods are thus legally identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 
2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 
986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); 
Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).  The parties’ 
goods have, moreover, no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or classes of purchasers and 
are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of purchasers.”  In re Viterra 
Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. 
Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Applicant’s and 
registrant’s overlapping goods are thus related. 
 
Applicant’s goods are also related to registrant’s goods because of the way that they are commonly 
marketed and sold / provided to the consuming public.  Goods need not be identical or even 
competitive to find a likelihood of confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 
1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 
USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only be “related in some 
manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the 
mistaken belief that [the goods and/or services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. 
Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-
Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  The attached 
evidence from Ikea.com, CrateAndBarrel.com, and  PotteryBarn.com shows that plastics plates and 
cups are commonly marketed and sold from the same sources, under the same brands or marks, as 
home goods like bowls, trays, grinders, and oven mitts.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 
USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 
1271-72 (TTAB 2009).  Ikea, for example, markets and sells all of the aforementioned goods, all under 
the Ikea brand name.  Applicant’s goods are thus related to registrant’s goods.  Id.
 
Applicant’s goods are, in light of the foregoing, related to registrant’s goods for likelihood of confusion 
purposes.
 
Conclusion
 
The marks CHEF'S UNIQUE and UNIQUE are confusingly similar, when those marks are considered 
in their entireties, despite an additional descriptive term in the applied-for mark.  Applicant’s goods are 
also related to the goods identified in the registration.  Registration for the applied-for mark is therefore 
refused under Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 1968704.
 
 
II.    DISCLAIMER REQUIRED - "CHEF'S"
 
Applicant must disclaim the term "CHEF'S" because it merely describes an ingredient, quality, 
characteristic, function, feature, purpose, use, or intended user of applicant’s goods.  See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from the American Heritage dictionary shows that a "chef" is "a cook, especially 
the chief cook of a large kitchen staff."  Applicant's goods in this case include various kitchen items,e.g. "Bowls; Dinnerware; Plates; Basting brushes; Cheese boards; Hand-operated grinders; Household 
utensils, namely, turners; Household utensils, namely, kitchen tongs; Household utensils, namely, 
spatulas; Ice cream scoops; Kitchen ladles; Napkin holders; Oven mitts; Slotted spoons; Spice racks; 
Trays for household purposes; Whisks; Hand-operated pepper grinders; Hand-operated spice grinders", 
which presumably encompass all goods of those kinds, including such goods used by, or intended for 
use by, a chef.  The term "CHEF'S" in the applied-for mark therefore merely describes an intended user 
of applicant's goods.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “CHEF'S” apart from the mark as shown.

Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
