Summary of Issues
 
Sections 1 and 45 Refusal - Specimen Not Acceptable - This Partial Refusal Applies to Class 16  
•
Classification & Identification of Goods Amendment Requirement 
•
Multiple-Class Application Requirements 
•
 
Sections 1 and 45 Refusal - Specimen Not Acceptable - This Partial Refusal Applies to Class 
 
Specimen does not show use in specific class(es).  Registration is refused because the specimen does 
not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in connection with any of the 
goods specified in International Class 16.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 
37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79 (TTAB 
2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An application based on Trademark Act Section 
1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each 
international class of goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  15 
U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re Gulf Coast 
Nutritionals, Inc., 106 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013). 
 
Specifically, none of the submitted specimens show books or art in International Class 16. Rather, the 
specimens submitted only show candles.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual use 
in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of an 
amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the goods 
and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.”  The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing 
an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before 
publication.  This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, 
including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirements set forth below.
 
Classification & Identification of Goods Amendment Requirement
 
Applicant has classified “candles” in International Class 21; however, the proper classification is 
International Class 4. Therefore, applicant may respond by (1) adding International Class 4 to the 
application and reclassifying these goods and/or services in the proper international class, (2) deleting 
“candles” from the application, or (3) deleting the remainder of the items in the identification and 
reclassifying the specified goods and/or services in the proper international class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.86(a), 6.1; TMEP §§1403.02 et seq. If applicant adds one or more international classes to the 
application, applicant must comply with the multiple-class requirements specified in this Office action.
 
The identification for “books” in International Class 16 is indefinite and too broad and must be clarified 
because the wording does not make clear whether the “books” are goods or services and if those goods 
or services are in more than one international class. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03(e), 
1402.11(a)(x). Thus, applicant must amend the identification to specify the format, type, and subject 
matter of the books. See TMEP §§1402.03(e), 1402.11(a)(x).
 
With respect to format, applicant must specify whether the books are (1) electronic and downloadable 
in International Class 9, (2) electronic and recorded on computer media in International Class 9, (3) 
printed in International Class 16, and/or (4) provided online and non-downloadable in International 
Class 41. In addition, applicant must indicate the subject matter (e.g., history, biology). See TMEP 
§§1402.03(e), 1402.11(a)(x).
 
The following are examples of acceptable formats for identifications for books (additional information 
must be provided in each identification below, as indicated in the curly brackets):
 
Downloadable electronic books in the field of {indicate subject matter} in International 
Class 9;
 
Printed books in the field of {indicate subject matter} in International Class 16; or
 
Providing online non-downloadable books in the field of {indicate subject matter} in 
International Class 41.
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “art” in the identification of goods in International Class 16 because 
it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording isindefinite because it does not specify the nature or material composition of the goods. Further, this 
wording could identify goods  in more than one international class. For example, "works of art of 
paper" are in International Class 16 and "works of art of precious metal" are in International Class 14.  
 
The wording “and other gifts” in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified because 
it fails to identify specific goods. See TMEP §1402.03(a). Therefore, applicant must delete this 
indefinite wording from the identification and specify the common commercial or generic name for 
these goods.  In an identification, an applicant must use the common commercial or generic name for 
the goods, be specific and all-inclusive, and avoid using indefinite words or phrases. TMEP §§1402.01, 
1402.03(a). Further, applicant may amend the identification to list only those items that are within the 
scope of the goods set forth in the initial application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. Scope is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of the 
wording in the identification. TMEP §1402.07(a).
 
The examining attorney’s suggested amendments to the identification are in bold text below. Applicant 
may adopt the following wording, if accurate:
 
International Class 4: candles 
 
International Class 9: downloadable electronic books in the field of {indicate subject 
matter}
 
International Class 16: Printed books in the field of {indicate subject matter}
 
International Class 21: candle holders
 
International Class 41: Providing online non-downloadable books in the field of 
{indicate subject matter}
 
Applicant should note the following additional requirement.
 
Multiple-Class Application Requirements
 
 
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already 
paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application identifies 
goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 5 classes; 
however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 2 classes. Applicant must either 
(a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) restrict the 
application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce for 
each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for class 4; and applicant needs a specimen for classes9, 16, 21, 41. See more 
information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or 
advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce on or 
in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as early 
as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(a) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).

TMEP §1402.04.

have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
