Mark:  THE JOHN CASH SHOW
Correspondence Address:  
LELAND J. MACK JR., ESQ. 
MACK LAW PLLC

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
2(d) Likelihood of Confusion 
•
Name of Individual
•
Additional Fee - TEAS Plus Status Lost
•
 
2(d) LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION - CLASS 025 ONLY
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 2255134. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
The applicant has applied to register the mark "THE JOHNNY CASH SHOW" for use in connection 
with "Baseball caps and hats; Sweatshirts; T-shirts; Tank-tops." The mark in the cited Registration is 
"JOHNNY CASH" for use in connection with "clothing, namely, t-shirts, baseball caps, and caps." 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-
by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 
1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 
F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those 
factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in 
every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) 
(quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods . See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 
1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 
1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 
USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the 
cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
The dominant portion of the applied-for mark and the mark in the cited Registration convey the same 
commercial impression. 
 
Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or 
dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 
USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 
751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or 
generic for a party’s goods is typically less significant or less dominant when comparing marks. In re 
Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie 
Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Consequently, the issue is whether the applied-for mark component "JOHNCASH" is confusingly similar to "JOHNNY CASH".
 
"Johnny" is an informal version of "John", both being names. As such, "JOHNNY CASH" and "JOHN 
CASH" create the same commercial impression, one being the informal version of the other.
 
See attached from:
 
https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/johnny 
("Informal: John")
 
It should be noted that a mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in any lettering style; 
the rights reside in the wording or other literal element and not in any particular display or rendition. 
See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty 
Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. §2.52(a); TMEP 
§1207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a mark presented in stylized characters and/or with a design element generally 
will not avoid likelihood of confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters because the word 
portion could be presented in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 
101 USPQ2d at 1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 
1983) (stating that “the argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable where one party 
asserts rights in no particular display”).
 
As such, the marks at issue are identical and therefore likely to cause confusion.
 
Relatedness of Goods/Services
 
Both the applied-for mark and the mark in the cited Registration seek or have protection for "t-shirts" 
and "baseball caps," as wells related clothing. The goods therefore are identical. Neither the application 
nor the registration(s) contains any limitations regarding trade channels for the goods and therefore it is 
assumed that registrant’s and applicant’s goods are sold everywhere that is normal for such items, i.e., 
clothing and department stores. Thus, it can also be assumed that the same classes of purchasers shop 
for these items and that consumers are accustomed to seeing them sold under the same or similar 
marks. See Kangol Ltd. v. KangaROOS U.S.A., Inc., 974 F.2d 161, 23 USPQ2d 1945 (Fed. Cir. 1992); 
In re Smith & Mehaffey, 31 USPQ2d 1531 (TTAB 1994); TMEP §1207.01(a)(iii).
 
That is all to say that in this instance, the marks are highly related. Furthermore, the goods will likely 
be sold to the same type of consumers and through similar channels of trade.  As such, the similarities 
among the marks and goods so great as to create a likelihood of confusion among consumers. 
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods , but to 
protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer. See 
In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Therefore, any 
doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the registrant. TMEP 
§1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1265, 62 USPQ2d 
1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 
1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
NAME OF AN INDIVIDUAL
 
Applicant must clarify whether the name "JOHN CASH" in the mark identifies a particular livingindividual. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§813, 1206.03. In this case, the application neither 
specifies whether the name in the mark identifies a particular living individual nor includes a written 
consent. See TMEP §§813.01(a)-(b), 1206.04(a), 1206.05.
 
To register a mark that consists of or comprises the name of a particular living individual, including a 
first name, pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, an applicant must provide a written consent 
personally signed by the named individual. 15 U.S.C. §1052(c); TMEP §§813, 1206.04(a).
 
Accordingly, if the name in the mark does not identify a particular living individual , applicant 
must submit a statement to that effect (e.g., “The name shown in the mark does not identify a particular 
living individual.”).
 
However, if the name in the mark does identify a particular living individual , applicant must 
submit both of the following:
 
(1) The following statement : “The name(s) shown in the mark identifies a living individual(s) 
whose consent(s) to register is made of record.” If the name is a pseudonym, stage name, or 
nickname, applicant must provide the following statement: “JOHN CASH identifies [ENTER 
SPECIFIC NAME HERE, IF OTHER THAN SHOWN IN MARK], a living individual whose 
consent is of record.”
 
(2) A written consent, personally signed by the named individual(s), as follows: “I, John 
Cash [OR ENTER SPECIFIC NAME HERE, IF OTHER THAN SHOWN IN MARK], consent 
to the use and registration of my name, JOHN CASH, as a trademark and/or service mark with 
the USPTO.”
 
For an overview of the requirements pertaining to names appearing in marks, and instructions on how 
to satisfy this requirement online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response 
form, please go to http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/law/consent.jsp .
 
Failing to respond to this inquiry may result in a refusal to register the mark. See In re Cheezwhse.com, 
Inc. , 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); TMEP §814. 
 
Although applicant's mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
If applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below.
 
$100 PER CLASS FEE REQUIRED – TEAS PLUS STATUS LOST
 
Processing fee required. Applicant must submit an additional processing fee of $100 per class because 
the application as originally filed did not meet the TEAS Plus application filing requirements. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.22(c); TMEP §§819.01-.01(q), 819.03. Specifically, applicant failed to meet the following 
requirement(s): a consent to register the mark from the person identified in the mark (or 
conversely, if appropriate, a statement that the name or portrait in the mark does not identify a 
living individual) was not provided.
 
The additional processing fee is required regardless of whether applicant satisfies these applicationrequirements.
 
Accordingly, the application will no longer be treated as TEAS Plus; it is now considered a TEAS 
Standard application. See 37 C.F.R. §2.22(c); TMEP §819.03.
