SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Amended Identification of Goods and Services Requirement
•
Multiple-Class Application Requirements 
•
Section 44(d) Advisory
•
 
AMENDED IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES REQUIREMENT
 
Applicant has classified “providing information via a website on clothing fashion” in International 
Class 35; however, the proper classification is International Class 45. Therefore, applicant may respond 
by (1) adding International Class 45 to the application and reclassifying these goods and/or services in 
the proper international class, (2) deleting “providing information via a website on clothing fashion” 
from the application, or (3) deleting the remainder of the items in the identification and reclassifying 
the specified goods and/or services in the proper international class. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.86(a), 6.1; 
TMEP §§1403.02 et seq. If applicant adds one or more international classes to the application, 
applicant must comply with the multiple-class requirements specified in this Office action.
 
The wording “casual clothing; athletic clothing; sports clothing; exercise clothing; jackets; belts; caps” 
in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified because the types of clothing being 
provided is unclear. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.
 
The wording “online sales of clothing” in the identification of services is indefinite and must be 
clarified because the type of services being provided is unclear. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§1402.01. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 16: Stickers
 
Class 18: Wallets; backpacks; fanny packs 
 
Class 25: Casual clothing, namely, {specify, e.g. shirts}; athletic clothing, namely, {specify, e.g. 
shirts}; sports clothing, namely, {specify, e.g. shirts}; exercise clothing, namely, {specify, e.g. 
shirts}; {specify, e.g. hunting, riding, knit, suede} jackets; pants; shorts; socks; underwear; 
clothing belts; gloves; hats; bandannas; headbands; caps being headwear
 
Class 28: Bobblehead dolls; collectable toy figures 
 
Class 35: Wholesale store services featuring clothing; retail store services featuring clothing; online 
sales of clothing online retail store services featuring clothing
 
Class 45: Providing information via a website on clothing fashion 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broadenor expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e). Additionally, for U.S. applications filed under Trademark Act 
Section 44(e), the scope of the identification for purposes of permissible amendments may not exceed 
the scope of the goods and/or services identified in the foreign registration.  37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
Marmark, Ltd. v. Nutrexpa, S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845 (TTAB 1989) (citing In re Löwenbräu 
München, 175 USPQ 178, 181 (TTAB 1972)); TMEP §§1012, 1402.01(b).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Sections 1(b) and 44:
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that 
are classified in at least 6 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 5 
class(es).  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the 
submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already 
paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Sections 1(b) and 44 multiple-class application and how to 
satisfy the requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see 
the Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
SECTION 44(d) ADVISORY 
 
The application specifies both an intent to use basis under Trademark Act Section 1(b) and a claim of 
priority under Section 44(d) based on a foreign application. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 1126(d); 37 
C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2), (a)(4). However, no copy of a foreign registration has been provided even though 
the application indicates applicant’s intent to rely on Section 44(e) as an additional basis for 
registration. See 15 U.S.C. §1126(e).
 
An application with a Section 44(e) basis must include a true copy, photocopy, certification, or certified 
copy of a foreign registration from an applicant’s country of origin. 15 U.S.C. §1126(e); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §§1004, 1004.01, 1016. In addition, an applicant’s country of origin must be a 
party to a convention or treaty relating to trademarks to which the United States is also a party, or must 
extend reciprocal registration rights to nationals of the United States by law. 15 U.S.C. §1126(b); 
TMEP §§1002.01, 1004.Therefore, applicant must provide a copy of the foreign registration from applicant’s country of origin 
when it becomes available. TMEP §1003.04(a). A copy of a foreign registration must consist of a 
document issued to an applicant by, or certified by, the intellectual property office in applicant’s 
country of origin. TMEP §1004.01. If applicant’s country of origin does not issue registrations or 
Madrid Protocol certificates of extension of protection, applicant may submit a copy of the Madrid 
Protocol international registration that shows that protection of the international registration has been 
extended to applicant’s country of origin. TMEP §1016. In addition, applicant must also provide an 
English translation if the foreign registration is not written in English. 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP 
§1004.01(a)-(b). The translation should be signed by the translator. TMEP §1004.01(b).
 
If the foreign registration has not yet issued, or applicant requires additional time to procure a copy of 
the foreign registration (and English translation, as appropriate), applicant should so inform the 
trademark examining attorney and request that the U.S. application be suspended until a copy of the 
foreign registration is available. TMEP §§716.02(b), 1003.04(b).
 
If applicant cannot satisfy the requirements of a Section 44(e) basis, applicant may request that the 
mark be approved for publication based solely on the Section 1(b) basis. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 
1126(e); 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §§806.02(f), 806.04(b), 1003.04(b). Although the mark may be 
approved for publication on the Section 1(b) basis, it will not register until an acceptable allegation of 
use has been filed. See 15 U.S.C. §1051(c)-(d); 37 C.F.R. §§2.76, 2.88; TMEP §1103. Please note that, 
if the U.S. application satisfied the requirements of Section 44(d) as of the U.S. application filing date, 
applicant may retain the priority filing date under Section 44(d) without perfecting the Section 44(e) 
basis, provided there is a continuing valid basis for registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(3)-(4); TMEP 
§§806.02(f), 806.04(b).
 
Alternatively, applicant has the option to amend the application to rely solely on the Section 44(e) basis 
and request deletion of the Section 1(b) basis. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §806.04. The foreign 
registration alone may serve as the basis for obtaining a U.S. registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3); 
TMEP §806.01(d).

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
