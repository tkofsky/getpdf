SEARCH RESULTS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.

SPECIMEN, 
INFORMATION 
REQUIREMENT
 
Digitally created or altered image or mockup is not an acceptable specimen.  Registration is 
refused because the specimen appears to consist of a digitally created or altered image or a mockup of a 
depiction of the mark on the goods or their packaging and does not show the applied-for mark as 
actually used in commerce in International Class(es) 28.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (c); TMEP §§904.04(a)(iii), 904.07(a). 
 
An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for 
mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a).  “Use in commerce” means (1) a bona fide use of the applied-for mark in the ordinary course 
of trade (and not merely to reserve a right in the mark), (2) the mark is placed in any manner on the 
goods, packaging, tags or labels affixed to the goods, or displays that directly associate the mark with 
the goods and have a point-of-sale nature, and (3) the goods are actually sold or transported in 
commerce.  See 15 U.S.C. §1127.
 
An image of a product or packaging that has been digitally created or altered to include the mark or a 
mockup of how the mark may be displayed on the product or packaging is not a proper specimen for 
goods because it does not show actual use of the mark in commerce.  See 15 U.S.C. §1127; 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(c); TMEP §904.04(a)(i).
 
In this case, the specimen shows the mark on a tag that is not attached to a dog toy, and photographs of 
a toy camera with the mark digitally superimposed onto the image. These specimens show the mark 
intentionally placed (both digitally and physically) on or by the goods to create a specimen for 
submission to the USPTO; they do not reflect how consumers see the mark with the goods in 
commerce. Therefore, the specimen does not show actual use of the mark in commerce. 
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to the specimen refusal by satisfying one of the following 
options for each applicable international class: 
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual use in 
commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of an 
amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the goods 
identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified substitute specimen” is a 
specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in a signed affidavit or supportedby a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if 
appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the 
application or prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.”  The substitute specimen 
cannot be accepted without this statement.  For instructions on how to submit a different 
specimen using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Specimen webpage.
 
Applicants submitting a webpage as a specimen for goods must include the URL and the date the 
page was accessed or printed either directly on the specimen itself or in a separate statement, 
supported by an affidavit or declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 verifying such information.  See 
37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing an 
amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before publication.  This 
option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, including a specimen.
 
If applicant submits an acceptable verified substitute specimen or amends to Section 1(b), the 
requirement below for additional information/documentation about the original specimen will be 
withdrawn.  The requirement below as to the original specimen will be made final if applicant submits 
a substitute specimen that is not acceptable or does not amend to Section 1(b), and does not also 
respond completely to the requirement below.
 
Additional information/documentation about original specimen(s) required.  To permit proper 
examination of the application record for compliance with use in commerce requirements, applicant 
must respond to the following requirement for information and documentation about the specimen(s).  
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§814, 904.04(a)(iii).  A specimen must show the mark as actually used 
in commerce, which means use in the ordinary course of trade, and not merely to reserve a right in the 
trademark.  15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1052, 1127.  Because the specimen of record appears to be digitally 
created or altered, or is a mockup, further information is necessary to determine whether the specimen 
is in actual use in commerce. 
 
Answer for each specimen/photograph/image previously provided.  For any website source, 
applicant must provide (1) an image of the webpage, (2) the date it was accessed or printed, and (3) the 
complete URL address.  In re ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (TTAB 2020) 
(citing In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018)); TMEP §710.01(b).  Providing only a 
website address or hyperlink to the webpage is not sufficient to make the materials of record.  In re 
ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (citing In re Olin Corp., 124 USPQ2d 1327, 
1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB Solomon Assocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); 
TBMP §1208.03); TMEP §814.
 
(1)  Identify the particular good(s) listed in the application for which the specimen(s) was 
submitted to show use of the mark.
 
(2)  Explain whether the specimen was created for submission with this application.  If so, 
specify the date each specimen was created.  If applicant used the image(s) of the goods shown in 
the specimen(s) from a third-party website, provide the URL of the website and a digital copy of 
relevant webpage(s) for each image.
 
(3)  Provide information about and examples of how applicant’s goods appear in the actual salesenvironment.
(a)  If sold in stores, provide a representative sample of the name(s) of the stores and of 
photographs showing the goods for sale in the named stores, such as photographs of the 
sales displays or goods on shelves with the mark. 
(b)  If sold online, provide a representative sample of the name(s) of the online retailers, 
the website URL(s) for each named retailer, and a digital copy of the webpages showing 
the goods for sale on the named website.
(c)  If sold in another type of sales environment (e.g., catalogs, trade shows), identify the 
environment and provide photographs and/or documentation showing the goods for sale in 
that environment. 
 
(4)  If the information in question (3) about how the goods appear in the actual sales environment 
is not available to applicant, please describe how applicant’s goods are sold or transported and 
provide photographs and other documentation showing how applicant’s mark appears on the 
goods and/or its packaging when the goods are sold or transported to or within the United States.
 
(5)  For each category of sales environment specified in response to questions (3) and (4), specify 
when the goods bearing the mark were first available for purchase within the United States, the 
date of the first sale of the goods to or within the United States, and whether the goods are still 
for sale to or within the United States in that environment.
 
(6)  For the goods identified in response to question (1), provide documentation that shows 
payment or other consideration made for the goods, redacting personal or private information of 
buyers as necessary.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information.  See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814.  Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration.  In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
 
 
REQUIREMENT FOR ADDITIONAL SPECIMEN SUBMISSIONS
 
Given the wide variety and range of unrelated goods that applicant has listed in the application, 
applicant must submit additional specimens to allow for a complete and accurate examination of the 
application and assessment of the registrability of the subject mark, in accordance with Rule 2.61(b).  
37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); see TMEP §904.01(a).
 
Applicant should submit specimens demonstrating use of the mark on all the following goods:
 
Bobsleds;
1. 
Trampolines;
2. 
Body-building apparatus;
3. 
Body-training apparatus;
4. 
Christmas tree ornaments and decorations;
5. 
Christmas trees of synthetic material;
6.Elbow guards for athletic use;
7. 
Electric action toys;
8. 
Fishing harnesses;
9. 
Game tables;
10. 
Infant toys;
11. 
Pet toys;
12. 
Play houses;
13. 
Roller skates;
14. 
Skateboard trucks;
15. 
Sport balls;
16. 
Surf boards;
17. 
Tabletop games;
18. 
Toy cameras;
19. 
Toy vehicles 
 
20. 
 
If applicant is unable to provide specimens to support use of these items, applicant must delete these 
entries, or amend the filing basis for those goods that were not in proper use as of the application filing 
date to an intent to use basis under Section 1(b).  This option will later necessitate additional fees and 
filing requirements such as providing a specimen for these goods at a subsequent date.
 
Failure to comply with a requirement to furnish additional specimens is grounds for refusing 
registration.  In re Harley, 119 USPQ2d 1755, 1757-58 (TTAB 2016); TMEP §814.  Merely stating 
that evidence is available on applicant’s or a third party website or providing a hyperlink of such a 
website is an insufficient response and will not make the additional specimens of record.  See In re 
Planalytics, Inc., 70 USPQ2d 1453, 1457-58 (TTAB 2004).

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
