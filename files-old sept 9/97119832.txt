SUMMARY OF ISSUES:

•
Partial abandonment advisory
•
 
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES MUST BE CLARIFIED
The identification of goods and services is indefinite and must be clarified. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.01.  In particular, applicant must clarify that the "active chemical ingredients" are for use 
in "the manufacture of" fertilizers and must make clear that the "proteins" are for use in "the food" 
industry.  Additionally, applicant must specify the nature of the "carbon capture equipment" as 
indicated below.  To the extent that this carbon capture equipment is a type of machinery, then it is 
properly classified in Class 7, rather than Class 11.  Further, applicant must clarify the service it is 
providing with respect to "gas capture credits," as indicated below in bold.  
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate:
 
International Class 001: Active chemical ingredients for use in the manufacture of 
fertilizers; proteins for use in the food industry; protein for food for human consumption in 
raw material form for the food industry
 
International Class 004: Renewable fuels using at least one electrochemically derived 
reactant such as CO and/or H2 derived from electrochemically reducing CO2 in water
 
International Class 007: Organic waste compost machines
 
International Class 011: Carbon capture equipment in the nature of [specify the common 
commercial name of the goods. See TMEP §1402.01. If the goods have no common 
commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the product. See id.] for home 
applications using electrochemical cells to pull CO2 from the air; carbon capture 
equipment in the nature of [specify the common commercial name of the goods. See 
TMEP §1402.01. If the goods have no common commercial or generic name, applicant 
must describe the product. See id.]
for home applications using solid sorbents to pull CO2 from the air
 
International Class 036: Brokerage of gas capture credits based on amounts of gas 
captured directly from atmospheric air, namely, carbon dioxide capture credits, methanecapture credits and/or nitrous oxide capture credits on behalf of others
 
International Class 040: Treatment of materials, namely, treatment of carbon dioxide for 
use in manufacturing into consumer goods; processing of raw materials from carbon 
dioxide for the manufacture of consumer goods; providing a website that features 
information in the field of the processing of raw materials for manufacturing consumer 
goods 
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Applicant should note the following advisory.

Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
