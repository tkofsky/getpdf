below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office

2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKSThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02. 
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Entity Clarification Required
•
 
ENTITY CLARIFICATION REQUIRED 
 
Applicant's business name includes the foreign business designation "Gmbh"; however, applicant set 
forth "corporation" as the legal entity in the application. This business designation is generally 
considered the equivalent of a "Limited Liability Company." See TMEP app. D. Therefore, applicant 
must clarify the entity type in the application. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(3), 2.61(b); TMEP §803.03(i). 
Applicant may satisfy this requirement by amending the legal entity to one of those immediately listed 
above from Appendix D of the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (TMEP) for this business 
designation, as appropriate. See TMEP §803.03(i).
 
Alternatively, if applicant maintains that the legal entity in the application properly identifies 
applicant’s entity type, applicant must provide an explanation as to why the identified entity type is 
more similar to a "corporation" in this instance than to the legal entities listed in TMEP Appendix D. 
See id.
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration will be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).
 
QUESTIONS
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney to resolve the issues in this Office 
action. Although the USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions, communication by 
phone or email is permissible to agree to proposed amendments to the application that will immediately 
place the application in condition for publication, registration, or suspension. See 37 C.F.R. §2.62(c); 
TMEP §707.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119500
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
