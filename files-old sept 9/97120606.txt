Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that so resembles a registered mark 
that it is likely a potential consumer would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the source of the 
services of the applicant and registrant.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  A determination of likelihood of 
confusion under Section 2(d) is made on a case-by-case basis and the factors set forth in In re E. I. du 
Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) aid in this 
determination.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d 1344, 1349, 98 USPQ2d 1253, 
1256 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citing On-Line Careline, Inc. v. Am. Online, Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1085, 56 
USPQ2d 1471, 1474 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).  Not all the du Pont factors, however, are necessarily relevant or 
of equal weight, and any one of the factors may control in a given case, depending upon the evidence of 
record.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d at 1355, 98 USPQ2d at 1260; In re 
Majestic Distilling Co., 315 F.3d 1311, 1315, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see In re E. I. 
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d at 1361-62, 177 USPQ at 567.In this case, the following factors are the most relevant:  similarity of the marks, similarity and nature 
of the services, and similarity of the trade channels of the services.  See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Dakin’s Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d 
1593, 1595-96 (TTAB 1999); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
COMPARISON OF THE MARKS
 
In a likelihood of confusion determination, the marks in their entireties are compared for similarities in 
appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression. In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 
1323, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1748 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 
746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve 
Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 
2005)); In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 
1973); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v).
 
In the present case, applicant’s mark is REFRAME and registrant’s mark is REFRAME. These marks 
are identical in appearance, sound, and meaning, “and have the potential to be used . . . in exactly the 
same manner.” In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), aff’d, 866 F.3d 1315, 
123 USPQ2d 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Additionally, because they are identical, these marks are likely to 
engender the same connotation and overall commercial impression when considered in connection with 
applicant’s and registrant’s respective services. Id. Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar.
 
Furthermore, where the marks of the respective parties are identical, as in this case, the degree of 
similarity or relatedness between the services needed to support a finding of likelihood of confusion 
declines. See In re Country Oven, Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 443903, at *5 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), aff’d, 866 F.3d 1315, 123 USPQ2d 1744 
(Fed. Cir. 2017)); TMEP §1207.01(a); see also In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1207, 26 USPQ2d 
1687, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 1993).
 
COMPARISON OF THE SERVICES
 
The services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).  The compared services 
need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. 
Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 
214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).  They need only 
be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding their marketing are such that they 
could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., 
Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of entities that provide software for insurance brokering and 
insurance information, as well as fraud insurance and prevention services and/or risk management and 
consulting services, all under the same mark, establishes that the same entity commonly provides the 
relevant services and markets the services under the same mark (See attached evidence from Allstate®, 
Liberty Mutual®, Geico®, Travelers®, fticonsulting.com, and securian.com).  Thus, applicant’s andregistrant’s services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey 
Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 
1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the services, but to 
protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer.  
See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  Therefore, any 
doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the registrant.  TMEP 
§1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1265, 62 USPQ2d 
1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 
1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
In light of the similarities between the marks and the relatedness of the services, it is likely that 
consumers who encounter the parties' services will falsely conclude that they originate from the same 
source.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  If applicant submits arguments in 
support of registration, applicant must also address the requirement below.
 
 
AMENDMENT OF IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES REQUIRED
 
The identification of services is unacceptable because it contains indefinite wording and must be 
clarified.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.  The wording “non-downloadable web-based 
application” in the identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because it does not 
identify particular services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must amend this 
wording to specify the common commercial or generic name of the services. See TMEP §1402.01. If 
the services have no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe or explain the 
nature of the services using clear and succinct language. See id. 
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate: 
 
International Class 042:  "Providing temporary use of Nnon-downloadable web-based 
application for use in brokering insurance, obtaining insurance policy data, insurance claims 
submission and management, providing insurance information, providing estate planning 
information, and financial planning; providing temporary use of Nnon-downloadable web-
based application for use in underwriting insurance"
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand the 
services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06.  Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action.Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action.  See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.  The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails 
can be used for informal communications and are included in the application record.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(c), 2.191; TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
