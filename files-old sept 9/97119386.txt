The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SUMMARY OF ISSUES:

SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 4382063. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.  
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark, BLACKSTAR COWBOY COFFEE in stylized wording 
with a design for "Coffee; Coffee and coffee substitutes; Coffee based beverages; Coffee beans; Coffee 
drinks; Ground coffee beans; Prepared coffee and coffee-based beverages; Roasted coffee beans" in 
International Class 030. 
 
Registrant's mark is COWBOY COFFEE CO. in stylized wording with a design for "Coffee" in 
International Class 030. 
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Applicant's mark is BLACKSTAR COWBOY COFFEE in stylized wording with a design; Registrant's 
mark is COWBOY COFFEE CO.  The marks create the same commercial impression because both 
marks contain the similar phrase COWBOY COFFEE.
 
Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of 
terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See 
Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), 
aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 
1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH 
confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM 
and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-
(iii).  Here, the marks both contain the phrase COWBOY COFFEE, which creates a similar overall 
commercial impression, making consumer confusion likely. 
 
When evaluating a composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is normally 
accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, beremembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods and/or services. In re 
Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks 
must be compared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is 
accorded greater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word 
portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant 
Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 
1983)).  Thus, the stylization and design elements in the marks do not diminish the similarity created by 
the marks' similar wordings.
 
While applicant's mark contains the additional term BLACKSTAR and registrant's mark contains the 
disclaimed wording CO., where the goods and/or services of an applicant and registrant are identical or 
virtually identical, the degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding that 
confusion is likely declines. See Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 
1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. 
Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Because the marks have similar phrases and create the same commercial impression, the marks are 
considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes. 
 
Relatedness of the Goods
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark, BLACKSTAR COWBOY COFFEE in stylized wording 
with a design for "Coffee; Coffee and coffee substitutes; Coffee based beverages; Coffee beans; Coffee 
drinks; Ground coffee beans; Prepared coffee and coffee-based beverages; Roasted coffee beans" in 
International Class 030. 
 
Registrant's mark is COWBOY COFFEE CO. in stylized wording with a design for "Coffee" in 
International Class 030. 
 
When analyzing an applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services for similarity and relatedness, that 
determination is based on the description of the goods and/or services in the application and registration 
at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use. See Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital 
LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1323, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Octocom Sys. Inc. v. 
Hous. Computers Servs. Inc., 918 F.2d 937, 942, 16 USPQ2d 1783, 1787 (Fed. Cir. 1990)).
 
In this case, the goods and/or services in the application and registration(s) of "coffee" are identical. 
Therefore, it is presumed that the channels of trade and class(es) of purchasers are the same for these 
goods and/or services. See Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1372, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 
(Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir.2012)). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the registration(s) use(s) broad wording to describe coffee, which presumably encompasses 
all goods and/or services of the type described, including applicant’s more narrow Coffee; Coffee based 
beverages; Coffee beans; Coffee drinks; Ground coffee beans; Prepared coffee and coffee-based 
beverages; Roasted coffee beans.  See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 
(TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, 
applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 
1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 
1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 
1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 
2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods and/or services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of 
trade, or classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same 
class of purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 
1005 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related. 
 
Accordingly, the goods are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of confusion analysis.  
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods are related, there is a likelihood of confusion as to the 
source of applicant's goods.  Therefore, applicant's mark is not entitled to registration.  
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “COFFEE” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The word COFFEE is encompassed by applicant's identification of goods.  Thus, the wording merely 
describes applicant’s goods and/or services because applicant's goods are coffee.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “COFFEE” apart from the mark as shown.For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
SPECIMEN REFUSED
 
Specimen is merely a drawing or depiction of the mark. Registration is refused because the 
specimen is merely a photocopy of the drawing or a depiction of the applied-for mark and does not 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the goods and/or services in International 
Class(es) 030. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 
2.56(a), (c); In re Chica, 84 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (TTAB 2007); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 
1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing 
the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods and/or services 
identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include: 
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the 
filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for 
the goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement 
made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The 
substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in 
commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the 
amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this 
statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filingrequirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
DESCRIPTION OF MARK AMENDMENT REQUIRED
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one uses broad, vague 
language that does not accurately describe the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. 
Descriptions must be accurate and identify all the literal and design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.37; TMEP §808.02. In this case, the description is vague because the location of the word 
BLACKSTAR in relation to the words COWBOY COFFEE is unclear.
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate: The mark consists of a stylized design of the 
words "BLACKSTAR COWBOY COFFEE" with a star used as the letter "A" in the spelling of 
"STAR".  The word "BLACKSTAR" is stacked above the words "COWBOY COFFEE".

“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
