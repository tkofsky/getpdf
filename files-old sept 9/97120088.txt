Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Section 2(e)(1) – Merely Descriptive Refusal 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature and characteristic of 
applicant’s goods and services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP 
§§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
Here, applicant has applied to register the mark OIL REFINING for use in connection with 
"petroleum, raw or refined" in Class 4, "oil refining machines" in Class 7, "industrial refining towers 
for distillation" in Class 11, and "refinement of fuel materials; fuel refining; oil refining; production, 
treatment and refinement of fuel, diesel fuel, biofuel and biodiesel fuel for others" in Class 40. 
 
The combination of "OIL", meaning “petroleum”, and "REFINING",  meaning “to become pure or 
perfected”, immediately conveys that applicant’s goods and services pertain to perfected petroleum as a 
good and perfecting petroleum as a service.  See attached dictionary definitions from Merriam 
Webster.  In fact, applicant’s identification confirms that its goods and services feature this 
characteristic because it states that applicant provides "petroleum, refined" in Class 4, "oil refining 
machines" in Class 7, "industrial refining towers for distillation" in Class 11, and "refinement of fuel 
materials; fuel refining; oil refining; production, treatment and refinement of fuel, diesel fuel, biofuel 
and biodiesel fuel for others" in Class 40.  See applicant’s identification.  Moreover, the attached 
Internet evidence demonstrates that the terms "OIL REFINING" are used commonly in the industry to 
refer to "transforming crude oil into marketable products such as fuels, lubricants, and 
kerosene". See attached evidence from Science Direct.  Thus, based on this evidence, the terms "OIL" 
and "REFINING" merely describe a feature and characteristic of applicant’s goods and services in thatapplicant transforms crude oil into marketable products such as fuel.
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods and/or services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not 
registrable. In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re 
Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as 
hypodermic, aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 
(TTAB 2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner 
that is an integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services is the combined mark 
registrable. See In re Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial 
Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 
364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
goods and/or services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to 
the goods and/or services. Specifically, the term "OIL" modifies the term "REFINING" to create a 
congruous, descriptive meaning that applicant provides perfected petroleum as a good as well as 
services pertaining to perfecting petroleum.
 
Ultimately, when purchasers encounter applicant’s goods and services using the mark OIL 
REFINING, they will immediately understand the mark as indicating a feature and characteristics of 
the goods and services, and not an indication that applicant is the source of the goods and services. 
Therefore, the mark is merely descriptive, and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(e)(1) of the 
Trademark Act.  
 
Advisory Regarding Mark Appearing To Be Generic 
 
In addition to being merely descriptive, the applied-for mark appears to be generic in connection with 
the identified goods and/or services. “A generic mark, being the ‘ultimate in descriptiveness,’ cannot 
acquire distinctiveness” and thus is not entitled to registration on either the Principal or Supplemental 
Register under any circumstances. In re La. Fish Fry Prods., Ltd., 797 F.3d 1332, 1336, 116 USPQ2d 
1262, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int’l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc., 782 F.2d 
987, 989, 228 USPQ 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); see TMEP §§1209.01(c) et seq., 1209.02(a). 
Therefore, the trademark examining attorney cannot recommend that applicant amend the application 
to proceed under Trademark Act Section 2(f) or on the Supplemental Register as possible response 
options to this refusal. See TMEP §1209.01(c).  
 
Response Options to Refusals 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
Drawing Amendment Not Accepted Due to Material Alteration - Original Drawing RemainsOperative 
 
Applicant has requested to amend the mark in the application. The USPTO cannot accept the proposed 
changes because they would materially alter the mark in the drawing filed with the original application. 
37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)(2), (b)(2); TMEP §807.14. Accordingly, the proposed amendment will not be 
entered; the previous drawing of the mark will remain operative. See TMEP §807.17.
 
The original drawing shows the mark as OIL REFINING. The proposed amended drawing shows the 
mark as CHP+ADU.
 
The USPTO cannot accept an amendment to a mark if it will materially alter the mark in the drawing 
filed with the original application. 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)(2), (b)(2); TMEP §807.14. An amendment to the 
mark is material when the USPTO would need to republish the mark with the change in the USPTO 
Trademark Official Gazette to fairly present the mark to the public. In re Thrifty, Inc., 274 F.3d 1349, 
1352, 61 USPQ2d 1121, 1123-24 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing In re Hacot-Columbier, 105 F.3d 616, 620, 
41 USPQ2d 1523, 1526 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §807.14.
 
That is, an amendment is material if the altered mark does not retain “the essence of the original mark” 
or if the new and old forms do not “create the impression of being essentially the same mark.” In re 
Hacot-Columbier, 105 F.3d at 620, 41 USPQ2d at 1526 (quoting Visa Int’l Serv. Ass’n v. Life-Code 
Sys., Inc., 220 USPQ 740, 743-44 (TTAB 1983)); see, e.g., In re Who? Vision Sys., Inc., 57 USPQ2d 
1211, 1218 (TTAB 2000) (amendment from “TACILESENSE” to “TACTILESENSE” a material 
alteration); In re CTB Inc., 52 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (TTAB 1999) (amendment of TURBO with a 
design to just the typed word TURBO without design a material alteration).
 
When determining materiality, the addition of any element that would require a further search of the 
USPTO database for conflicting marks is also relevant. In re Guitar Straps Online LLC, 103 USPQ2d 
1745, 1747 (TTAB 2012) (citing In re Pierce Foods Corp., 230 USPQ 307, 308-09 (TTAB 1986)); In 
re Who? Vision Sys. Inc., 57 USPQ2d at 1218-19; TMEP §807.14.
 
In the present case, applicant’s proposed amendment would materially alter the mark in the drawing 
filed with the original application because the marks are not the same; that is, the originally submitted 
mark and the amended mark look and sound differently and have different commercial impressions.  
Specifically, the commercial impression of OIL REFINING pertains to goods and services relating to 
refining oil; whereas, the commercial impression of CHP+ADU is that of an acronym, a formula, or an 
abbreviation.  Because the marks looks and sound differently and have different commercial 
impressions, the amended drawing is considered a material alteration and is not accepted.  
 
To avoid the application from abandoning, applicant must respond to this issue. TMEP §807.17. 
Applicant may respond by (1) withdrawing the request to amend the drawing, or (2) arguing that the 
proposed amendment is not a material alteration of the mark.
 
For more information about changes to the mark in the drawing after the application filing date, please 
go to the Drawing webpage.  
 
Entity Type Mismatch - Amendment Required
 
The name of an individual person appears in the section of the application intended for the trademark 
owner’s name; however, the legal entity is set forth as a limited liability company. Applicant mustclarify this inconsistency. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), (a)(3)(i)-(ii), 2.61(b); TMEP §803.02(a).
 
Specifically, the owner of the mark is listed as "Randy C. Stubbs", but the entity type is listed as a 
Texas "limited liability company".  Applicant must resolve this discrepancy.   
 
If applicant is an individual, applicant should simply request that the legal entity be amended to 
“individual” and must indicate his/her country of citizenship for the record. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(i); 
TMEP §803.03(a). Alternatively, if applicant is a limited liability company, applicant must provide the 
correct name of the limited liability company and the U.S. state or foreign country of incorporation or 
organization. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §803.03(h).
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration may be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and

§§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.
 
Advisory Regarding Hiring a Trademark Attorney 
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for
