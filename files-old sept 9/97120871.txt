SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 5204737. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-
by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 
1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 
F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those 
factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in 
every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) 
(quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 
1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 
1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 
USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the 
cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Comparison of the Marks 
 
The applied-for mark is: BLAZIN' CYCLE 
 
The registered mark is: BLAZE 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b). Notably, applicant’s mark and registrant’s mark share the similar 
wording BLAZIN' and BLAZE in each of their respective marks.Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or 
dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 
USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 
1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Greater weight is often given to this 
dominant feature when determining whether marks are confusingly similar. See In re Detroit Athletic 
Co., 903 F.3d at 1305, 128 USPQ2d at 1050 (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d at 1407, 41 USPQ2d at 
1533-34).
 
Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any trademark 
or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 
F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between VEUVE 
ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent 
feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate 
Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding 
similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because “consumers 
must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 
128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial words is 
particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”).  In this case the first 
wording in the applied-for mark  is the wording BLAZIN' therefore, it is the dominant wording in the 
mark and it is similar in meaning and commercial impression of the registered mark. 
 
Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or 
dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 
USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 
1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Matter that is descriptive of or 
generic for a party’s services is typically less significant or less dominant in relation to other wording in 
a mark. See Anheuser-Busch, LLC v. Innvopak Sys. Pty Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1816, 1824-25 (TTAB 2015) 
(citing In re Chatam Int’l Inc., 380 F.3d 1340, 1342-43, 71 USPQ2d 1944, 1946 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  In 
the present case, the wording CYCLE in the applied-for mark is merely descriptive of or generic for 
applicant’s services. Thus, this wording is less significant in terms of affecting the mark’s commercial 
impression, and renders the wording BLAZIN' the more dominant element of the mark.
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.”  
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b).  The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks.  In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 
USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 
1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Geigy Chem. Corp. v. Atlas Chem. Indus., Inc., 438 F.2d 1005, 1007, 169 
USPQ 39, 40 (C.C.P.A. 1971)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 (Fed. Cir. 2019); 
TMEP §1207.01(b).  In the present case, registrant’s mark is “BLAZE” and applicant’s applied-for 
mark is “BLAZIN' ”.  Both marks use conjugations of the word “BLAZE”, where registrant uses the 
root form of the noun and verb and the applicant uses the present participle of the word.  Thus, the 
marks have a similar commercial impression in connection to the goods.
 
Consumer confusion has been held likely for marks that do not physically sound or look alike but thatconvey the same idea, stimulate the same mental reaction, or may have the same overall meaning.  
Proctor & Gamble Co. v. Conway, 419 F.2d 1332, 1336, 164 USPQ 301, 304 (C.C.P.A. 1970) (holding 
MISTER STAIN likely to be confused with MR. CLEAN on competing cleaning products); see In re 
M. Serman & Co., 223 USPQ 52, 53 (TTAB 1984) (holding CITY WOMAN for ladies’ blouses likely 
to be confused with CITY GIRL for a variety of female clothing); H. Sichel Sohne, GmbH v. John 
Gross & Co., 204 USPQ 257, 260-61 (TTAB 1979) (holding BLUE NUN for wines likely to be 
confused with BLUE CHAPEL for the same goods); Ralston Purina Co. v. Old Ranchers Canning Co., 
199 USPQ 125, 128 (TTAB 1978) (holding TUNA O’ THE FARM for canned chicken likely to be 
confused with CHICKEN OF THE SEA for canned tuna); Downtowner Corp. v. Uptowner Inns, Inc., 
178 USPQ 105, 109 (TTAB 1973) (holding UPTOWNER for motor inn and restaurant services likely 
to be confused with DOWNTOWNER for the same services); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
In sum, for the foregoing reasons, the marks are confusingly similar. 
 
Comparison of the Services 
 
The services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int'l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi). 
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The applicant’s identified services are: “Indoor cycling instruction; Organizing, arranging, and 
conducting cycling events; Physical fitness studio services, namely, providing exercise classes, body 
sculpting classes, and group fitness classes
 
The registrant’s identified services are: “Fitness boot camps; Business training; Consulting services in 
the fields of fitness and exercise; Personal fitness training services; Personal fitness training services 
and consultancy; Personal fitness training services featuring aerobic and anaerobic activities combined 
with resistance and flexibility training; Personal training services, namely, strength and conditioning 
training and speed training; Personal trainer services; Physical fitness consultation; Physical fitness 
training of individuals and groups; Physical fitness training services; Providing a website featuring 
information on exercise and fitness; Providing information in the field of exercise training; Providing 
personal fitness training for firefighters; Providing personal training and physical fitness consultation to 
corporate clients to help their employees make physical fitness, strength, conditioning, and exercise 
alterations in their daily living; Providing personal training and physical fitness consultation to 
individuals to help them make physical fitness, strength, conditioning, and exercise improvement in 
their daily living; Sports training services" 
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the services stated in the application 
and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 
1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).
 
In this case, the registration uses broad wording to describe fitness training services, which presumably 
encompasses all  services of the type described, including applicant’s more narrow specific types of 
training services. See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); 
Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015). Thus, applicant’s and 
registrant’s services are legally identical. See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 
(TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 
USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 
2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.” In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are related.
 
The foregoing demonstrates that a consumer familiar with registrant’s mark used on registrant’s 
services, upon encountering applicant’s mark used on applicant’s services would likely be confused and 
mistakenly believe that the services emanate from a common source.  Therefore, registration is refused 
under Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
ADVISORY: PRIOR-FILED APPLICATIONS 
 
The filing dates of pending U.S. Application Serial Nos. 88335240, 88275374, and 97046653 precede 
applicant’s filing date.  See attached referenced applications.  If one or more of the marks in the 
referenced applications register, applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act 
Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion with the registered mark(s).  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 
37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office 
action, action on this application may be suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed 
referenced applications.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the marks in the referenced 
applications.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s 
right to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
If applicant responds to the refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “CYCLE” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s services.  See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a).This wording is encompassed by applicant’s identification of services. 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “CYCLE” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120871
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
