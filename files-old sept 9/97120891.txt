SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive 
•
Supplemental Register
•
Disclaimer Advisory 
•
 
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is a laudatory phrase that describes the geographic 
scope or location and type of legal services will provide.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).  
 
The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s goods 
and/or services, not in the abstract. DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 
675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b). “Whether 
consumers could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the 
test.” In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).  The question is not whether 
someone presented only with the mark could guess what the goods and/or services are, but “whether 
someone who knows what the goods and[/or] services are will understand the mark to convey 
information about them.” DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1254, 
103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting In re Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1316-17 
(TTAB 2002)); In re Mueller Sports. Med., Inc., 126 USPQ2d 1584, 1587 (TTAB 2018).  
 
Websites and webpages and dictionary definitions, applicant's identification, and specimens of record 
including any explanatory text or items such as tags or labels contained within are generally a 
competent source for determining how the public perceives the mark in connection with applicant’s 
goods and/or services. See In re N.C. Lottery, 866 F.3d 1363, 1367-68, 123 USPQ2d 1707, 1709-10 
(Fed. Cir. 2017); In re Nett Designs, Inc., 236 F.3d 1339, 1341, 57 USPQ2d 1564, 1566 (Fed. Cir. 
2001) (citing In re Bed & Breakfast Registry, 791 F.2d 157, 160, 229 USPQ 818, 819 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); 
TMEP §1209.01(b).
 
Here, applicant seeks registration of: UTAH'S ORIGINAL PERSONAL INJURY LAW FIRM in 
relation to legal services. 
 
As exhibited by applicant's address applicant is located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Thus, it is reasonable toassume that applicant will provide its legal services to resident's of Utah, likely Salt Lake City. Thus, 
UTAH is descriptive of the geographic scope of the services or the place in which they will be 
rendered. 
 
“Marks that are merely laudatory and descriptive of the alleged merit of a product [or service] are . . . 
regarded as being descriptive” because “[s]elf-laudatory or puffing marks are regarded as a condensed 
form of describing the character or quality of the goods [or services].” DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. 
Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1256, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1759 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting In 
re The Boston Beer Co., 198 F.3d 1370, 1373, 53 USPQ2d 1056, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1999)); TMEP 
§1209.03(k). The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has held that the word “ORIGINAL” used alone 
or paired with descriptive wording is merely laudatory and descriptive of goods or services being the 
first of their kind. See In re Ervin, 1 USPQ2d 1665, 1666 (TTAB 1986) (holding THE “ORIGINAL” 
merely laudatory and descriptive of applicant’s scorer for playing euchre as the first of its kind); Gen. 
Foods Corp. v. Ralston Purina Co., 220 USPQ 990, 994 (TTAB 1984) (holding ORIGINAL BLEND 
merely laudatory and descriptive of applicant’s cat food comprising a first-of-its-kind combination of 
ingredients).
 
 "PERSONAL INJURY" describes the type of legal services that applicant will render as exhibited by 
applicant's specimen of record. Finally, a "LAW FIRM" is merely a business that renders legal services 
and is thus descriptive of the provider of the services at issue. 
 
Taken together, applicant's mark, UTAH'S ORIGINAL PERSONAL INJURY LAW FIRMis a 
laudatory phrase that describes the geographic scope or location and type of legal services will provide, 
namely, personal injury legal services rendered by a first/one-of-its-kind law firm in or around the Utah 
area. 
 
Accordingly, registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act. Although 
applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by submitting 
evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, applicant is advised of the following: 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTER ADVISORY 
 
A mark in an application under Trademark Act Section 1(b) is not eligible for registration on the 
Supplemental Register until an acceptable amendment to allege use under 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been 
filed. 37 C.F.R. §§2.47(d), 2.75(b); TMEP §§815.02, 1102.03. When a Section 1(b) application is 
successfully amended to the Supplemental Register, the application effective filing date will be the date 
applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for the amendment to allege 
use. TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b).
 
DISCLAIMER ADVISORY 
 
Applicant is advised that, if the application is amended to seek registration on the Principal Register 
under Trademark Act Section 2(f) or on the Supplemental Register, applicant will be required to 
disclaim “PERSONAL INJURY LAW FIRM” because such wording appears to be generic in the 
context of applicant’s goods and/or services. See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Wella Corp., 565 F.2d 143, 
144, 196 USPQ 7, 8 (C.C.P.A. 1977); In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 USPQ 766, 768 
(TTAB 1986); TMEP §1213.03(b).
 
Applicant may submit a disclaimer in the following format:No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “PERSONAL INJURY LAW FIRM” apart 
from the mark as shown.
 
TMEP §1213.08(a)(i).
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
