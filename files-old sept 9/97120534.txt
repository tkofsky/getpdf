Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.

Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusal 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 3924542. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark AMERICAN WELDING SUPPLY CO in stylized text with 
a design for “on-line wholesale and retail store services featuring welders and plasma cutters, welding 
supplies, gas cutting and welding tools, welding helmets and safety equipment, welding accessories, 
and welder service parts; wholesale and retail store services featuring welders and plasma cutters, 
welding supplies, gas cutting and welding tools, welding helmets and safety equipment, welding 
accessories, and welder service parts” in International Class 35.
 
Registrant’s mark is AWG AMERICAN WELDING & GAS INC in stylized text with a design for, in 
relevant part, “retail store and distributorship services in the field of gas supply, welding supplies and 
welding equipment” in International Class 35. 
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321,110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b). Moreover, although marks are compared in their entireties, one 
feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re 
Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie 
Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), 
(c)(ii). Greater weight is often given to this dominant feature when determining whether marks are 
confusingly similar. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d at 1305, 128 USPQ2d at 1050 (citing In re 
Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d at 1407, 41 USPQ2d at 1533-34).
 
Here, applicant’s mark, AMERICAN WELDING SUPPLY CO, is confusingly similar to the registered 
mark, AWG AMERICAN WELDING & GAS INC. Both marks begin with the same dominant 
wording AMERICAN WELDING which means the marks look and sound similar initially. Consumers 
are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any trademark or service 
mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 
1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between VEUVE ROYALE and two 
VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent feature’ as the first 
word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century 
Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding similarity between 
CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because “consumers must first notice th[e] 
identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 
1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial words is particularly significant 
because consumers typically notice those words first”).
 
Similarly, the common phrasing between the marks, AMERICAN WELDING, not only makes the 
marks look and sound similar but it also conveys an overall similar commercial impression. Marks may 
be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases 
appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l 
Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 
USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly 
similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and 
CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
While the two marks have slightly different stylization and design elements, both marks have a similar 
commercial impression in the design of the marks as both contain a type of spark or firework like 
element with bands. Consumer confusion has been held likely for marks that do not physically sound or 
look alike but that convey the same idea, stimulate the same mental reaction, or may have the same 
overall meaning. Proctor & Gamble Co. v. Conway, 419 F.2d 1332, 1336, 164 USPQ 301, 304 
(C.C.P.A. 1970) (holding MISTER STAIN likely to be confused with MR. CLEAN on competing 
cleaning products); see In re M. Serman & Co., 223 USPQ 52, 53 (TTAB 1984) (holding CITY 
WOMAN for ladies’ blouses likely to be confused with CITY GIRL for a variety of female clothing); 
H. Sichel Sohne, GmbH v. John Gross & Co., 204 USPQ 257, 260-61 (TTAB 1979) (holding BLUE 
NUN for wines likely to be confused with BLUE CHAPEL for the same goods); Ralston Purina Co. v. 
Old Ranchers Canning Co., 199 USPQ 125, 128 (TTAB 1978) (holding TUNA O’ THE FARM forcanned chicken likely to be confused with CHICKEN OF THE SEA for canned tuna); Downtowner 
Corp. v. Uptowner Inns, Inc., 178 USPQ 105, 109 (TTAB 1973) (holding UPTOWNER for motor inn 
and restaurant services likely to be confused with DOWNTOWNER for the same services); TMEP 
§1207.01(b). In the present case, the marks do look and sound alike as well as convey a similar 
commercial impression which means there is a likelihood of confusion between the marks.  
 
When evaluating composite marks consisting of words and a design, the word portion is normally 
accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be 
remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods and/or services. In re 
Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks 
must be compared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is 
accorded greater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word 
portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant 
Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 
1983)).
 
Because the marks look and sound similar and create a similar commercial impression, the marks are 
considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes. 
 
Relatedness of the Services 
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
In this case, the registration uses broad wording to describe "retail store and distributorship services in 
the field of gas supply, welding supplies and welding equipment," which encompasses all services of 
the type described, including applicant's more narrow "on-line wholesale and retail store services 
featuring welders and plasma cutters, welding supplies, gas cutting and welding tools, welding helmets 
and safety equipment, welding accessories, and welder service parts" and "wholesale and retail store 
services featuring welders and plasma cutters, welding supplies, gas cutting and welding tools, welding 
helmets and safety equipment, welding accessories, and welder service parts." See, e.g., In re Solid 
State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 
USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are legally identical.  
See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, 
Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter 
IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay 
Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).Additionally, the services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
Accordingly, the services are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of confusion analysis. 
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are similar and the services are legally identical, there is a likelihood of confusion as 
to the source of applicant’s services, and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(d) of the 
Trademark Act.
 
Response Options to Refusals 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirements set forth below.
 
Mark Description - Amendment Required
 
Applicant must delete from the description any text that does not reference things appearing in the 
mark, such as interpretation, assessment, or analysis of the mark elements, or indications of how the 
mark is or is not used or intended to be used. In the present case, the word "you" appears in the mark 
description and WELDING is misspelled in the last sentence. A description must identify only the 
literal and design elements shown in the drawing. See 37 C.F.R. §2.37; TMEP §808.02. In 
addition, applicant did not provide a complete description specifying where each color appears in the 
literal and design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). 
Specifically, the mark description did not identify the color of the spark that appears above the letter 
"I". Therefore, applicant must provide a corrected mark description identifying all the colors in the 
mark and where they appear. See TMEP §807.07(a)(ii).
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate: 
 
The mark consists of the words "AMERICAN WELDING SUPPLY CO" in stylized letters. 
"AMERICAN" is shown in blue with a red fire spark on top of the letter "I" and a ribbon of red, 
white and blue starting on top of the spark and ending across the letter "A" in the color red. 
Underneath is the words "WELDING SUPPLY CO" in the color red. 
 
Disclaimer of Descriptive Wording Required 
 
Applicant must disclaim all the wording in the mark because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
First, the term AMERICAN must be disclaimed because the application identifies the address based inMiami, Florida, which is in the United States suggesting the origin of the services is America. In 
addition, WELDING SUPPLY must also be disclaimed because the application identifies "welding 
supplies" as part of the identification of services. Moreover, the term CO must also be disclaimed 
because business type designations and abbreviations such as “Corporation,” “Inc.,” “Company,” 
“LLC,” and “Ltd.” or family business designations such as “& Son’s” or “Bros.” must be disclaimed, 
because they merely indicate applicant’s business type or structure and generally have no source-
indicating capacity. TMEP §1213.03(d); see, e.g., Goodyear’s India Rubber Glove Mfg. Co. v. 
Goodyear Rubber Co., 128 U.S. 598, 602-03 (1888); In re Piano Factory Grp., Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1522, 
1526 (TTAB 2006); In re Patent & Trademark Servs., Inc., 49 USPQ2d 1537, 1539-40 (TTAB 1998). 
Thus, the wording AMERICAN WELDING SUPPLY CO merely describes applicant’s services as a 
company the supplies welding products likely based in America.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “AMERICAN WELDING SUPPLY CO” 
apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
