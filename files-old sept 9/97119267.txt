DECLARATION: The signatory being warned that willful false statements and the like are punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both,
under 18 U.S.C. § 1001, and that such willful false statements and the like may jeopardize the validity of the application or submission or
any registration resulting therefrom, declares that, if the applicant submitted the application or allegation of use (AOU) unsigned, all
statements in the application or AOU and this submission based on the signatory's own knowledge are true, and all statements in the
application or AOU and this submission made on information and belief are believed to be true.
STATEMENTS FOR UNSIGNED SECTION 1(a) APPLICATION/AOU: If the applicant filed an unsigned application under 15 U.S.C.
§1051(a) or AOU under 15 U.S.C. §1051(c), the signatory additionally believes that: the applicant is the owner of the mark sought to be
registered; the mark is in use in commerce and was in use in commerce as of the filing date of the application or AOU on or in connection with
the goods/services/collective membership organization in the application or AOU; the original specimen(s), if applicable, shows the mark in use
in commerce as of the filing date of the application or AOU on or in connection with the goods/services/collective membership organization in
the application or AOU; for a collective trademark, collective service mark, collective membership mark application, or certification mark
application, the applicant is exercising legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce and was exercising legitimate control over the
use of the mark in commerce as of the filing date of the application or AOU; for a certification mark application, the applicant is not engaged in
the production or marketing of the goods/services to which the mark is applied, except to advertise or promote recognition of the certification
program or of the goods/services that meet the certification standards of the applicant. To the best of the signatory's knowledge and belief, no
other persons, except, if applicable, authorized users, members, and/or concurrent users, have the right to use the mark in commerce,
either in the identical form or in such near resemblance as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods/services/collective
membership organization of such other persons, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive.
STATEMENTS FOR UNSIGNED SECTION 1(b)/SECTION 44 APPLICATION AND FOR SECTION 66(a)
COLLECTIVE/CERTIFICATION MARK APPLICATION: If the applicant filed an unsigned application under 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051(b),

specified in the application; the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce and had a bona fide intention to use the mark in
commerce as of the application filing date; for a collective trademark, collective service mark, collective membership mark, or certification
mark application, the applicant has a bona fide intention, and is entitled, to exercise legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce and
had a bona fide intention, and was entitled, to exercise legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce as of the application filing date;
the signatory is properly authorized to execute the declaration on behalf of the applicant; for a certification mark application, the applicant will
not engage in the production or marketing of the goods/services to which the mark is applied, except to advertise or promote recognition of the
certification program or of the goods/services that meet the certification standards of the applicant. To the best of the signatory's knowledge
and belief, no other persons, except, if applicable, authorized users, members, and/or concurrent users, have the right to use the mark in

NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below to enable further prosecution of the 
application. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Specimen(s) lack(s) references to the services 
 
Specimen does not show direct association between mark and services. Registration is refused 
because the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and the services and fails to 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the identified services in International 
Class(es) 35 and 42. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (b)(2); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(f)(ii), (g)(i). An application based 
on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used 
in commerce for each international class of services identified in the application or amendment to 
allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
When determining whether a mark is used in connection with the services in the application, a key 
consideration is the perception of the user. In re JobDiva, Inc., 843 F.3d 936, 942, 121 USPQ2d 1122, 
1126 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., 686 F.3d 1376, 1381-82, 103 
USPQ2d 1672, 1676 (Fed Cir. 2012)). A specimen must show the mark used in a way that would create 
in the minds of potential consumers a sufficient nexus or direct association between the mark and the 
services being offered. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2); In re Universal Oil Prods. Co., 476 F.2d 653, 655, 
177 USPQ2d 456, 457 (C.C.P.A. 1973); TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii).
 
To show a direct association, specimens consisting of advertising or promotional materials must (1) 
explicitly reference the services and (2) show the mark used to identify the services and their source. In 
re The Cardio Grp., LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 227232, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re WAY Media, LLC, 
118 USPQ2d 1697, 1698 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii). Although the exact nature of the 
services does not need to be specified in the specimen, there must be something that creates in the mind 
of the purchaser an association between the mark and the services. In re Adair, 45 USPQ2d 1211, 1215 
(TTAB 1997) (quoting In re Johnson Controls Inc., 33 USPQ2d 1318, 1320 (TTAB 1994)).
 
In the present case, the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and services in 
that the mark is used among a series of other marks without any context.  Viewing the entirety of the 
specimen(s), a consumer would not be able to discern or associate the mark AXIOMARK with any 
advertising or hosting of a server services.  As such, the specimens fail to demonstrate proper use.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).  Any webpage printout or 
screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or 
printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified 
statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); 
TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) wasin actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Advisories
 
Applicant is advised of the following issues.
 
Translation
 
Applicant’s English translation of literal portion of the mark in the application is unnecessary because 
this term appears to be arbitrary. TMEP §809.01(b)(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(9). The USPTO will 
disregard the translation; it will not be published on any registration certificate that may issue from this 
application. TMEP §809.03.  
 
Disclaimer
 
Applicant has disclaimed the entire applied-for mark; however, an entire mark may not be disclaimed. 
TMEP §1213.06; see 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Dena Corp. v. Belvedere Int’l Inc., 950 F.2d 1555, 
1560, 21 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 1991); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 n.1 
(TTAB 2001). Accordingly, the disclaimer is not accepted and will not be entered into the USPTO’s 
database. See TMEP §714.05(a).
 
Prior registration
 
Applicant’s claim of ownership of U.S. Registration No. 4657295 will not be published on any 
registration which may issue from this application because USPTO records show that the claimed 
registration is cancelled. Only claims of ownership of active registrations are published. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.36; TMEP §812.
 
Response guidelines
 
Applicant should include the following information on all correspondence with the Office: (1) the name 
and law office number of the trademark examining attorney, (2) the serial number and filing date of the 
application, (3) the date of issuance of this Office action, (4) applicant's name, address, telephonenumber and e-mail address (if applicable), and (5) the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.194(b)(1); TMEP §302.03(a). 
 
If applicant does not respond to this Office action within six months of the issue/mailing date, or 
responds by expressly abandoning the application, the application process will end and the trademark 
will fail to register. See 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.65(a), 2.68(a); TMEP §§718.01, 718.02. 
Additionally, the USPTO will not refund the application filing fee, which is a required processing 
fee. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(1)(i)-(iv), 2.209(a); TMEP §405.04.
 
When an application has abandoned for failure to respond to an Office action, an applicant may timely 
file a petition to revive the application, which, if granted, would allow the application to return to active 
status. See 37 C.F.R. §2.66; TMEP §1714. The petition must be filed within two months of the date of 
issuance of the notice of abandonment and may be filed online via the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) with a $100 fee. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(15)(ii), 2.66(a)(1), (b)(1).

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
