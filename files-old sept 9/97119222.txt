NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF THE USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting registered marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 
2(d). 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02. However, a mark in a prior-filed pending application may 
present a bar to registration of applicant’s mark.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES the applicant must address: 
 
Specimen Refusal - Partial
•
Amendment of the Identification of Goods and Services Required - Partial 
•
 
Also contained herein is an advisory regarding a potential Section 2(d) Refusal for a likelihood of 
confusion with a prior-filed application
 
POTENTIAL SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL ADVISORY - PRIOR FILED APPLICATIONS
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 90703411 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
Although the applicant is not required to respond to the issue of the prior pending application, the 
applicant must respond to the below refusal and requirement within six months of the mailing date of 
this Office action to avoid abandonment.
 
SPECIMEN REFUSAL - THIS PARTIAL REFUSAL APPLIES TO CLASS(ES) 35 ONLY
 
Specimen does not show use in specific class(es).  Registration is refused because the specimen does 
not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in connection with any of the goods and/or 
services specified in International Class(es) 35.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79 
(TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An application based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for 
each international class of goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege 
use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re 
Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013). 
 
Specifically, the specimen submitted appears to show the applied-for mark on bottles of cosmetics as 
well as associated with trainings but the specimen does not show the applied-for mark in connectionwith retail store services as the specimen does not show the applied-for mark in connection with selling 
of the goods listed in the identification of services or an advertisement for the selling of goods.  The 
identification of services specifies that the retail store services feature "skincare products such as eye 
serum, lip serum, skin cleansers, exfoliating scrub, hydrating masks, skin moisturizer, charcoal mask, 
beard oil; weight loss products including pills and collagen peptide; exfoliating gloves and acne 
treatments".  The specimen submitted shows the applied-for mark in selling training courses.  These are 
not included in the retail store services.  Therefore, the specimen submitted does not show the applied-
for mark in use in commerce in connection with Class 35 services listed in the identification of 
services.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include:  
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options.  Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the 
goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.”  The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing 
an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before 
publication.  This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, 
including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.RESPONSE TO REFUSAL
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
REQUIREMENTS
 
If applicant responds to the refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
AMENDMENT OF THE IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES REQUIRED - THIS 
PARTIAL REQUIREMENT APPLIES TO CLASS(ES) 35 ONLY
 
The applicant’s identification of goods and services is unacceptable, because it contains a significant 
amount of indefinite wording in Class 35 that requires further specification. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.01. 
 
First, applicant must correct the punctuation in the identification in Class 35 to clarify the individual 
items in the list of goods and/or services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01(a). Proper 
punctuation in identifications is necessary to delineate explicitly each product or service within a list 
and to avoid ambiguity. Commas, semicolons, and apostrophes are the only punctuation that should be 
used in an identification of goods and/or services. TMEP §1402.01(a). An applicant should not use 
colons, periods, exclamation points, and question marks in an identification. Id. In addition, applicants 
should not use symbols in the identification such as asterisks (*), at symbols (@), or carets. Id.
 
In general, commas should be used in an identification (1) to separate a series of related items 
identified within a particular category of goods or services, (2) before and after “namely,” and (3) 
between each item in a list of goods or services following “namely” (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion, bar soap, shampoo). Id. Semicolons generally should be used to separate a series 
of distinct categories of goods or services within an international class (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion; deodorizers for pets; glass cleaners). Id.
 
Thus, applicant should replace the semi-colons with colons in the identification of goods or 
services.  Please see below for suggested amendments.
 
Additionally, The wording “"such as" and "including"” in the identification of services in Class 35 is 
indefinite and must be deleted and replaced with a definite term, such as “namely,” “consisting of,” 
“particularly,” or “in particular.” See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03(a). The 
identification must be specific and all-inclusive. This wording is an open-ended term (e.g., “including” 
and “such as”) that is not acceptable because it fails to identify specific services. See TMEP 
§1402.03(a).  
 
The current Identification in Class 35 reads: 
 
On-line retail store services featuring skincare products such as eye serum, lip serum, skin cleansers, 
exfoliating scrub, hydrating masks, skin moisturizer, charcoal mask, beard oil; weight loss products 
including pills and collagen peptide; exfoliating gloves and acne treatments
 
The semi-colons are inappropriate to show items in a list and the overly broad wording "such as" and 
"including" must be deleted, therefore, the following amendment is suggested:On-line retail store services featuring skincare products, namely, such as eye serum, lip serum, skin 
cleansers, exfoliating scrub, hydrating masks, skin moisturizer, charcoal mask, beard oil;, weight loss 
products being including pills and collagen peptide;, exfoliating gloves and acne treatments
 
The following guidelines are provided for amending the identification:  
 
•    Use common commercial or generic names for the goods whenever possible. If there is no 
common commercial or generic name, describe the product and intended consumer as well as the 
main purpose and intended uses of the goods (TMEP § 1402.01); 
 
•    Use “namely” after broad terms (e.g., “accessories,” “apparatus,” “components,” “devices,” 
“equipment,” “materials,” “parts,” “systems” or “products”) followed by a list of the specific 
goods, e.g., “accessories, namely, [list specific goods]” (TMEP §§ 1402.01, 1402.03(a)); 
 
•    Remove parentheses and incorporate the parenthetical information into the description, if 
necessary. Parenthetical information is permitted only if it serves to explain or translate the 
matter immediately preceding the parenthetical phase, e.g., “obi (Japanese sash), (TMEP § 
1402.12); 
 
•    Use commas (1) to separate a series of related items identified within a particular category of 
goods, (2) before and after “namely,” and (3) between each item in a list of goods (TMEP § 
1402.01(a)); 
 
•    Use semicolons to separate a distinct category of goods within an International Class (TMEP 
§ 1402.01(a)).
 
Overall Identification
 
Therefore, the applicant may adopt the following identification of services, if accurate (deletions shown 
stricken and additions are shown in bold and italics):
 
International Class 003: Non-medicated skin care preparations; Non-medicated skin care preparations, 
namely, eye serum, lip serum, skin cleansers, exfoliating scrub, hydrating masks, skin moisturizer, 
charcoal mask, beard oil
 
International Class 035:On-line retail store services featuring skincare products, namely, such as eye 
serum, lip serum, skin cleansers, exfoliating scrub, hydrating masks, skin moisturizer, charcoal mask, 
beard oil;, weight loss products being including pills and collagen peptide;, exfoliating gloves and acne 
treatments
 
International Class 041: Education services, namely, providing courses, seminars, and workshops in the 
field of skin care treatments and services; Educational services, namely, providing on-line courses in 
the field of skin care treatments and services; Arranging and conducting of courses of instruction in the 
field of skincare 
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deletingitems to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
