Section 2(d) Refusal - Likelihood of Confusion 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 5011040 (GIFTED COIN). Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.  
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied for the mark GIFTCOIN in standard characters for:"Downloadable computer application software for blockchain-based platforms, namely, software 
for distributed applications and software using a consensus engine incorporating blockchain 
technology for securing data with cryptographic information; downloadable computer software 
platforms for developing and building of distributed software applications and distributed 
computing platforms; downloadable computer software platforms for blockchains" in 
International Class 9; and
•
"Cryptocurrency exchange services featuring blockchain technology" in International Class 36. 
•
 
Registrant's mark is GIFTED COIN in standard characters for "Crowdfunding services in the nature of 
accepting and administering monetary contributions from a group of individuals" in International Class 
36. 
 
Comparison of the Marks 
 
Applicant’s mark and the cited U.S. Registration No. 5011040 (GIFTED COIN) are likely to be 
confused due to their similarity. 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
In the present case, there is a likelihood of confusion because of the shared and similar wording in the 
marks.  Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts 
of terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. 
See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 
1986), aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 
F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and 
COMMUNICASH confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) 
(holding CONFIRM and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 
USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).  Here, the marks begin with the similar wording "GIFT" or "GIFTED", followed 
by the wording "COIN".  This shared and similar wording creates a similar look and sound, as well as a 
similar commercial impression centered on the concept of a coin presented as a gift to others. 
 
Therefore, as the marks look and sound similar and create a similar commercial impression, they are 
confusingly similar. 
 
Comparison of the Goods and Services 
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goodsand/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
As 
shown 
from 
the 
attached 
websites 
from bitcoinke.io, comparethecloud.net, opengeekslab.com, pixelplex.io, vent.finance, 
and rarefnd.com, it is quite common for the same parties to provide software/software platforms using 
blockchain technology, cryptocurrency services, and crowdfunding services under the same mark.  This 
evidence establishes that the same entity commonly provides the relevant goods and/or services and 
markets the goods and/or services under the same mark, that the relevant goods and/or services are sold 
or provided through the same trade channels and used by the same classes of consumers in the same 
fields of use, and that the goods and/or services are similar or complementary in terms of purpose or 
function (as blockchain software platforms and services are commonly used to provide crowdfunding 
services). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are considered related for likelihood 
of confusion purposes. See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 
2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Also, the trademark examining attorney has attached evidence from the USPTO’s X-Search database 
consisting of a number of third-party marks registered for use in connection with the same or similar 
goods and/or services as those of both applicant and registrant in this case. This evidence shows that the 
goods and/or services listed therein, namely software for developing software applications, 
cryptocurrency services, and crowdfunding services, are of a kind that may emanate from a single 
source under a single mark. See In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 1730, 1737 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Infinity Broad. Corp., 60 USPQ2d 1214, 1217-18 (TTAB 2001); In re Albert Trostel & Sons Co., 29 
USPQ2d 1783, 1785-86 (TTAB 1993); In re Mucky Duck Mustard Co., 6 USPQ2d 1467, 1470 n.6 
(TTAB 1988)); TMEP §1207.01(d)(iii).  
 
Therefore, the goods and services are related.
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods and services are related, there is a likelihood of confusion 
and applicant’s mark is not entitled to registration. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirements set forth below.
 
Identification of Goods and Services
 
The identification of goods and services is indefinite and must be clarified for the following reasons: 
 
The Class 9 wording "downloadable computer software platforms for blockchains" is unclear as 
to the nature of the goods and must specify the function of the software in relation to 
"blockchains" (such as managing cryptocurrency transactions using blockchain technology, see 
suggestion below).
•
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate (changes in bold):International Class 9: Downloadable computer application software for blockchain-based 
platforms, namely, software for distributed applications and software using a consensus engine 
incorporating blockchain technology for securing data with cryptographic information; 
downloadable computer software platforms for developing and building of distributed software 
applications and distributed computing platforms; downloadable computer software platforms for 
{specify the function of the software in relation to blockchains, e.g., managing 
cryptocurrency transactions using blockchain technology, etc.}
 
International Class 36: Cryptocurrency exchange services featuring blockchain technology 
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Request for Information
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must submit additional information about 
applicant’s goods and services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§814, 1402.01(e). Specifically, 
applicant must submit answers to the following questions:
 
Is applicant's software used to trade, manage, or transfer cryptocurrency coins or tokens?
•
Is applicant's software used to trade, mange, exchange, or otherwise provide gifts, including but 
not limited to gifts in the form of cryptocurrency coins or tokens?
•
Is applicant's software used to solicit, collect, or enable donations or charitable gifts, or to 
provide a platform for charitable gift giving? 
•
Is applicant's software used to develop or build platforms for donations or charitable gift giving, 
or to develop or build platforms for trading, managing, or transferring cryptocurrency coins or 
tokens?
•
Are applicant's cryptocurrency exchange services used to trade, manage, transfer, or 
exchange cryptocurrency coins or tokens? 
•
Are applicant's cryptocurrency exchange services used to exchange gifts, including but not 
limited to gifts in the form of cryptocurrency coins or tokens?
•
Are applicant's cryptocurrency exchange services related to donations or charitable gift giving via 
cryptocurrency or blockchain technology?
•
 
Factual information about the goods must clearly indicate how they operate, their salient features, and 
their prospective customers and channels of trade. Factual information about the services must clearly 
indicate what the services are and how they are rendered, their salient features, and their prospectivecustomers and channels of trade. Conclusory statements will not satisfy this requirement for 
information.
 
If applicant submits webpage evidence to satisfy this requirement, applicant must provide (1) an image 
of the webpage, (2) the date it was accessed or printed, and (3) the complete URL address. In re ADCO 
Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 
1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018)); TMEP §710.01(b). Providing only a website address or hyperlink to the 
webpage is not sufficient to make the materials of record. In re ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 
USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (citing In re Olin Corp., 124 USPQ2d 1327, 1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB 
Solomon Assocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); TBMP §1208.03); TMEP §814.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).

on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118941
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.

(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
