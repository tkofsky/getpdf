Issue date:  August 23, 2022
INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF OFFICE’S DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the Office’s database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
REFUSAL - MARK DIFFERS ON DRAWING AND SPECIMEN
•
REQUIREMENT - CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES
•
REQUIREMENT - COLOR CLAIM AND MARK DESCRIPTION
•
 
REFUSAL - MARK DIFFERS ON DRAWING AND SPECIMEN
 
Mark shown on drawing does not match mark on specimen. Registration is refused because the 
specimen does not show the mark in the drawing in use in commerce, which is required in the 
application or amendment to allege use. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 
C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). The mark appearing on the 
specimen and in the drawing must match; that is, the mark in the drawing “must be a substantially exact 
representation of the mark” on the specimen. See 37 C.F.R. §2.51(a)-(b); TMEP §807.12(a).
 
In this case, the specimen displays the mark as a blue square shape featuring a cut-out forming the letter 
"E". However, the drawing displays the mark as a blue square shape featuring a cut-out forming the 
letter "E" with the black wording "THEEDIGITAL" appearing to the right of the square shape. The 
mark on the specimen does not match the mark in the drawing because the mark in the specimen does 
not contain the black "THEEDIGITAL" wording. Applicant has thus failed to provide the required 
evidence of use of the mark in commerce. See TMEP §807.12(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) for each 
applicable international class that (a) shows the mark in the drawing in actual use in 
commerce for the goods and/or services in the application or amendment to allege use, and 
(b) was in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or 
prior to the filing of an amendment to allege use.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between 
the mark and the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) 
a photograph of business signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the 
sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP 
§1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(2)        Submit a request to amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 
1(b) (which includes withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no 
specimen is required before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s)and filing requirements such as providing a specimen.
 
The USPTO will not accept an amended drawing submitted in response to this refusal because the 
changes would materially alter the drawing of the mark in the original application or as previously 
acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b); TMEP §807.14. Specifically, the marks in the 
specimen does not include the black "THEEDIGITAL" wording. This wording is highly distinctive and 
contributes greatly the commercial impression of the mark. Deletion of distinctive matter from a  mark 
results in a material alteration of the mark. See In re Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc., 33 USPQ2d 1052 
(Comm’r Pats. 1993). For more information about drawings and instructions on how to satisfy these 
response options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Drawing webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
REQUIREMENT - CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES
 
The wording “Web Design” in the identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because 
the specific type of web design service must be indicated for example, website design, homepage and 
webpage design, design of computer website design software. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§1402.01.  
 
The services "Digital Marketing Services" are classified incorrectly. Applicant must amend the 
application to classify the goods and/or services in International Class 35. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(7), 
2.85; TMEP §§1401.02(a), 1401.03(b).
 
Applicant should note that any wording in bold, in italics, underlined and/or in ALL CAPS below 
offers guidance and/or shows the changes being proposed for the identification of goods and/or 
services.  If there is wording in the applicant’s version of the identification of goods and/or services 
which should be removed, it will be shown with a line through it such as this: strikethrough.  When 
making its amendments, applicant should enter them in standard font, not in bold, in italics, underlined 
or in ALL CAPS.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 35: Digital marketing services
 
Class 
42: Web 
design services, 
namely, 
___ 
{indicate 
particular 
services, 
e.g.,website 
design, homepage and webpage design, design of computer website design software} and Digital 
Marketing Services
 
See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.
 
An applicant may only amend an identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to add to or 
broaden the scope of the services.  37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); see TMEP §§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. 
Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please seethe USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04. 
 
Advisory – Multiple Class Application
 
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) 
already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 2 
classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 class(es). Applicant 
must either (a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or 
(b) restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
not acceptable for any international class. See more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between 
the mark and the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) 
a photograph of business signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the 
sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP 
§1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce 
on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as 
early as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(a) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
REQUIREMENT - COLOR CLAIM AND MARK DESCRIPTIONApplicant must clarify whether color is a feature of the mark because, although the drawing shows the 
mark in color, the application does not state whether color is a feature of the mark. 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 
2.52(b)(1), 2.61(b); see TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). Applicant must also submit an amended description 
of the mark because the current one is incomplete and does not describe all the significant aspects of 
the mark, in particular the design element forming the letter "E". 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 
808.02. Descriptions must be accurate and identify all the literal and design elements in the mark. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.37; TMEP §§808 et seq.
 
 
Applicant may respond to this requirement by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)       If color is not a feature of the mark, applicant must submit a black-and-
white drawing of the mark to replace the color drawing. See TMEP §807.07(a)(i). 
However, any other amendments to the drawing will not be accepted if they materially 
alter the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.72; see TMEP §§807.14 et seq. Applicant must also submit a 
revised description of all literal and design elements in the mark, deleting any reference to 
color, if appropriate. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. The following 
description is suggested, if accurate: The mark consists of a square shape that has a cut-
out forming the letter "E". To the right of the square shape is the stylized wording 
"THEEDIGITAL".
 
(2)       If color is a feature of the mark, applicant must submit a statement (a) 
listing all the colors that are claimed as a feature of the mark and (b) describing all the 
literal and design elements in the mark that specifies where each color appears in those 
elements. 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). Generic color names 
must be used to describe the colors in the mark, e.g., red, yellow, blue. TMEP 
§807.07(a)(i)-(ii). If black, white, and/or gray represent background, outlining, shading, 
and/or transparent areas and are not part of the mark, applicant must so specify in the 
description. See TMEP §807.07(d). The following color claim and description are 
suggested, if accurate: 
 
Color claim: The colors blue and black are claimed as a feature of the mark.
 
Description: The mark consists of a blue square shape that has a cut-out forming the 
letter "E". To the right of the square shape is the stylized black wording 
"THEEDIGITAL". The color white indicates transparent area and is not a part of 
the mark.
 
See TMEP §807.07(b).

your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
