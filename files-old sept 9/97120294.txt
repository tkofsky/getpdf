SEARCH RESULT
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL--MARK IS MERELY DESCRIPTIVE 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes the applicant’s goods and/or 
services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et 
seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services.  TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson 
LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 
1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of 
Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)). 
 
The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s goods 
and/or services, not in the abstract.  DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 
675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b).  “Whether 
consumers could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the 
test.”  In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).  Determining the descriptiveness 
of a mark is done in relation to an applicant’s goods and/or services, the context in which the mark isbeing used, and the possible significance the mark would have to the average purchaser because of the 
manner of its use or intended use.  See In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 
1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing In re Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d 960, 
963-64, 82 USPQ2d 1828, 1831 (Fed. Cir. 2007)); TMEP §1209.01(b).  Descriptiveness of a mark is 
not considered in the abstract.  In re Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 488 F.3d at 963-64, 82 USPQ2d at 1831.
 
“A mark may be merely descriptive even if it does not describe the ‘full scope and extent’ of the 
applicant’s goods or services.”  In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 
1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (citing In re Dial-A-Mattress Operating Corp., 240 F.3d 1341, 1346, 57 USPQ2d 
1807, 1812 (Fed. Cir. 2001)); TMEP §1209.01(b).  It is enough if a mark describes only one significant 
function, attribute, or property.  In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 
USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b); see In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 
F.3d at 1173, 71 USPQ2d at 1371.
 
The mark is SENSE ASSIGN FORECAST ENGAGE for "educational services and materials, namely 
[sic] onsite and remote training, experiential learning, and printed educational materials to promote 
situational awareness for proactive safety and staff engagement in healthcare settings and distribution 
of educational materials."  The mark is merely descriptive of the goods/services.  Situational awareness 
is the concept of being aware of one's environment and/or situation.  Steps in situational awareness are 
sensing the elements in the situation, assigning or comprehending the meaning of the elements, 
forecasting or predicting the future status of the elements, and engaging or taking action regarding the 
elements.  Please see the attached definitions and the excerpted representative articles describing 
situational awareness and the various steps in achieving and managing situational awareness.  The 
applicant's goods/services regarding situational awareness may feature and involve the steps of sensing, 
assigning, forecasting, and engaging.  And as stated in the identification, the goods/services involve 
"staff engagement."  
 
Two major reasons for not protecting descriptive marks are (1) to prevent the owner of a descriptive 
mark from inhibiting competition in the marketplace and (2) to avoid the possibility of costly 
infringement suits brought by the trademark or service mark owner. In re Abcor Dev. Corp., 588 F.2d 
811, 813, 200 USPQ 215, 217 (C.C.P.A. 1978); TMEP §1209. Businesses and competitors should be 
free to use descriptive language when describing their own goods and/or services to the public in 
advertising and marketing materials. See In re Styleclick.com Inc., 58 USPQ2d 1523, 1527 (TTAB 
2001). Others providing the same or similar goods/services would require the use of the wording(s) 
without fear of infringement suit.
 
Accordingly, the mark is not registrable on the Principal Register.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
OPTION TO OVERCOME REFUSAL--SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTER
 
Although an amendment to the Supplemental Register would normally be an appropriate response to 
this refusal(s), such a response is not appropriate in the present case.  The instant application was filed 
under Trademark Act Section 1(b) and is not eligible for registration on the Supplemental Register until 
an acceptable amendment to allege use meeting the requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been timely 
filed.  37 C.F.R. §2.47(d); TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03.If applicant files an acceptable allegation of use and also amends to the Supplemental Register, the 
application effective filing date will be the date applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 
37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for an amendment to allege use.  TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b).  
In addition, the undersigned trademark examining attorney will conduct a new search of the USPTO 
records for conflicting marks based on the later application filing date.  TMEP §§206.01, 1102.03. 
 
Please note that applications on the Supplemental Register are not subject to opposition under 15 
U.S.C. §1063; TMEP § 815.  Upon approval of the mark for registration, the record will indicate that 
the mark has been "Allowed for Supplemental Registration" rather than that the mark has been 
approved for publication.  Marks on the Supplemental Register are not published for opposition, but are 
issued as registered marks on the date that they are printed in the Official Gazette.  TMEP § 815.
 
INFORMALITIES
 
If applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS/SERVICES 
 
Some of the identification of goods/services are indefinite and must be clarified.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.  Applicant must amend the identification to specify the common 
commercial or generic name of the goods/services.  See TMEP §1402.01.  If the goods have no 
common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the product, its main purpose, and its 
intended uses.  See id.  If the services have no common commercial or generic name, applicant must 
describe or explain the nature of the services using clear and succinct language.  See id.
 
"Printed educational materials" are classified in class 16.
 
The application encompasses goods/services that are classified in more than one class.
 
For easier reference, the suggested amendments are shown in bold and italics.
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate: 
 
Printed educational materials featuring situational awareness for proactive safety and staff 
engagement in healthcare settings, in international class 16;
 
Educational services and materials, namely, onsite and remote training and experiential learning in the 
nature of in-person instruction regarding situational awareness for proactive safety and staff 
engagement in healthcare settings and distribution of educational materials in connection therewith, in 
international class 41.
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06.  Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended.  See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b).  The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by theordinary meaning of the wording in the identification.  TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b).  Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted.  TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.  To expedite prosecution of this trademark application, when amending the 
identification as required above, the Office strongly encourages the applicant to select pre-
approved wording contained within this manual that accurately describes the goods and/or 
services therein.  Failure to do so may result in delay.
 
CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS/SERVICES
 
If applicant adopts the suggested amendment of the identification of goods and/or services, then 
applicant must amend the classification to International Class(es) 16 and 41. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.32(a)(7), 2.85; TMEP §§805, 1401.
 
MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive numerical 
order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid (view 
the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that are classified 
in at least two (2) classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only one class(es).  
Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or restrict 
the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).

requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
