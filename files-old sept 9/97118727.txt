System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(d) Likelihood of Confusion Refusal
•
Mark Description
•
 
Section 2(d) Likelihood of Confusion Refusal 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 5371296 and 5459913. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
In the present case, the applied-for mark is "11 ONETEAM" in stylized font for "Business marketingand consulting services in the field of sports and entertainment, namely, arranging for development and 
production of marketing, endorsements, and licensed entertainment content featuring athletes; business 
consulting in the nature of identifying and developing opportunities for athletes to be featured in multi-
media entertainment content, and to license their name, image and likeness; management of athletes" in 
Class 35, and "Entertainment services in the nature of development, creation, production and 
distribution of multi-media entertainment content, films, television shows, motion pictures and audio 
programs featuring athletes" in Class 41. 
 
Registration No. 5371296 is "ONETEAM COLLECTIVE" and design for "Association services, 
namely, promoting the interests of professional football players in an organized league; business 
consulting services in business leadership development and business management" in Class 35. 
 
Registration No. 5459913 is "NFLPA ONE TEAM" and design for "Association services, namely, 
promoting the interests of professional football players in an organized league" in Class 35. 
 
Both registrations are owned by the same registrant. 
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Here, the applied-for mark is "11 ONETEAM" in stylized font, whereas the registered marks 
are "ONETEAM COLLECTIVE" in standard characters and "NFLPA ONE TEAM" and design.
 
All of the marks share the identical or nearly identical wording "ONETEAM" or "ONE TEAM". Marks 
may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or 
phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker 
Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub 
nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 
USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly 
similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and 
CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).  
 
While the registered marks and the applied-for mark have the additional design elements, those design 
elements are insufficient to overcome the confusing similarity between the marks. When evaluating a 
composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is normally accorded greater weight 
because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be remembered by them, and be used 
by them to refer to or request the goods and/or services. In re Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 
1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 
(Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks must be compared in their entireties, 
the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is accorded greater weight in determiningwhether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra 
Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 
710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).
 
Last, while the applied-for mark has the additional wording "11" and the registered marks have the 
additional wording "COLLECTIVE" and "NFLPA", that wording is also insufficient to overcome the 
confusing similarity between the marks. First, the wording "COLLECTIVE" is descriptive in 
Registration No. 5371296 and has been disclaimed. Although marks are compared in their entireties, 
one feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In 
re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 
753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). 
Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or generic for a party’s goods and/or services is typically less 
significant or less dominant when comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 
128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 
USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Second, because the 
applied-for mark and the registered marks share the identical, or nearly identical wording 
"ONETEAM" or "ONE TEAM" for related services, as noted below, consumers would likely believe 
that the applied-for mark was related to the registered family of marks. When comparing marks, “[t]he 
proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead whether the marks are sufficiently 
similar in terms of their commercial impression such that [consumers] who encounter the marks would 
be likely to assume a connection between the parties.” Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 
1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 
668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b). The proper focus 
is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who retains a general rather than specific impression of 
trademarks. In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Bay 
State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 (TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 
1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP §1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 
USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 2014).
 
Therefore, the applied-for mark is confusingly similar to the registrant's marks.
 
Relatedness of the Services 
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The applicant has identified "Business marketing and consulting services in the field of sports and 
entertainment, namely, arranging for development and production of marketing, endorsements, andlicensed entertainment content featuring athletes; business consulting in the nature of identifying and 
developing opportunities for athletes to be featured in multi-media entertainment content, and to license 
their name, image and likeness; management of athletes" in Class 35, and "Entertainment services in 
the nature of development, creation, production and distribution of multi-media entertainment content, 
films, television shows, motion pictures and audio programs featuring athletes", whereas the registrant 
has identified "Association services, namely, promoting the interests of professional football players in 
an organized league; business consulting services in business leadership development and business 
management" in Class 35. 
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots from Creative Artists Agency, Excel Sports 
Management, Independent Sports & Entertainment, Octagon, Wasserman, establishes that the same 
entity commonly provides "Business marketing and consulting services in the field of sports and 
entertainment, namely, arranging for development and production of marketing, endorsements, and 
licensed entertainment content featuring athletes; business consulting in the nature of identifying and 
developing opportunities for athletes to be featured in multi-media entertainment content, and to license 
their name, image and likeness; management of athletes", "Entertainment services in the nature of 
development, creation, production and distribution of multi-media entertainment content, films, 
television shows, motion pictures and audio programs featuring athletes", and "Association services, 
namely, promoting the interests of professional football players in an organized league; business 
consulting services in business leadership development and business management", and markets the 
services under the same mark.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are considered related for 
likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 
(TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
In addition, the greater the degree of similarity between the applied-for mark and the registered mark, 
the lesser the degree of similarity between the goods and/or services of the parties is required to support 
a finding of likelihood of confusion. In re C.H. Hanson Co., 116 USPQ2d 1351, 1353 (TTAB 2015) 
(citing In re Opus One Inc., 60 USPQ2d 1812, 1815 (TTAB 2001)); In re House Beer, LLC, 114 
USPQ2d 1073, 1077 (TTAB 2015) (citing In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1206, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 
1688 (Fed. Cir. 1993); Time Warner Ent. Co. v. Jones, 65 USPQ2d 1650, 1661 (TTAB 2002); In re 
Opus One Inc., 60 USPQ2d at 1815); TMEP §1207.01(a). Here, the marks share the identical or nearly 
identical, unique wording "ONETEAM" or "ONE TEAM" for related services.
 
Thus, for the reasons stated above, the applied-for mark is refused registration under Section 2(d) for a 
likelihood of confusion with the registered mark. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
Mark Description
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one uses unclear 
language that does not accurately describe the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. 
Descriptions must be accurate and identify all the literal and design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.37; TMEP §808.02. In this case, the description is unclear because the wording "consists of the 
number 1 and the number 1" is unclear whether this means that there is just one number 1 in the mark, 
or whether there are two, or whether this means that the number 11 is in the mark.The following description is suggested, if accurate, with changes in bold:
 
The mark consists of the stylized wording "11 ONETEAM", where the number "11" consists of 
two mirrored number "1"s forming a stylized arrow pointing up.
 
Response Guidelines 
 
For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal and/or requirement in this
