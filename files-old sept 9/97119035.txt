INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF OFFICE DATABASE - NO CONFLICTING MARKS FOUND
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02. 
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Amendment to the Identification of Services Required
Multiple-Class Application Requirements
 
AMENDMENT TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES REQUIRED
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “Internet based social networking, introduction, professional 
connection, and dating services” in the identification of services in International Class 45 because it is 
indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is 
indefinite because it does not make clear what the services are. Further, this wording could 
identify services in more than one international class. For example, "on-line professional networking 
services" are in International Class 35 and "Internet based social networking, introduction, and dating 
services" are in International Class 45.
 
Applicant may adopt the following amended identification of services, if accurate:
 
Class 9  -  Downloadable software in the nature of a mobile application for uploading, posting, 
showing, displaying, sharing, and discussing electronic media or data and the transmission of messages, 
photos, videos and data among users concerning social gatherings, making acquaintances, friendship, 
professional networking, dating, and long-term relationships 
 
Class 35 - On-line professional networking services
 
Class 45 - Dating services; Internet based social networking, introduction, and dating services
 
ADVISORY: SCOPE OF ORIGINAL IDENTIFICATION
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.Applicant should note the following additional requirements. 
 
MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that 
are classified in at least 3 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 
2 class(es).  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the 
submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already 
paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119035
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
