Section 2(d) Refusal

SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 5214218. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
The applicant seeks registration for the standard character LOL STUDIOS for Cinematographic 
adaptation and editing; Editing of television programmes; Editing or recording of sounds and images; 
Entertainment media production services for motion pictures, television and Internet; Entertainment 
services in the nature of development, creation, production and post-production services of multimedia 
entertainment content; Entertainment services in the nature of development, creation, production, 
distribution, and post-production of motion pictures; Entertainment services in the nature of 
development, creation, production, distribution, and post-production of television shows; Entertainment 
services, namely, multimedia production services; Entertainment services, namely, production of 
special effects including model-making services and related physical production elements for use in 
motion pictures; Entertainment services, namely, providing advice and information for music, video 
and film concept and script development; Film directing, other than advertising films; Film editing;

The registrant's mark is the design mark LOL for Entertainment services, namely, development, 
creation, production and post-production of website entertainment content; providing a website that 
displays trending news and information content in the field of entertainment based on social media; 
multimedia entertainment services in the nature of recording, production and post-production services 
in the fields of music and video; entertainment services, namely, providing a website featuring video 
presentations featuring news and information in the field of entertainment and current event news 
reporting in international class 041.  
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in anylikelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
The marks are confusingly similar
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Both marks contain the term LOL.  Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar 
terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar 
overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 
USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells 
Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding 
COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 
66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin 
Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS 
confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).  
 
The dominant element in both mark is the term LOL because the remaining wording in the applicant's 
mark will be disclaimed.  Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may 
be more significant or dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 
224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is 
descriptive of or generic for a party’s goods and/or services is typically less significant or less dominant 
when comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 
(Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. 
Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Consequently, the dominant elements in both marks are 
identical and the marks are confusingly similar. 
 
 
 
The services are related
 
The services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi). While the wording is 
slightly different, both the applicant and registrant provide "development, creation, production andpost-production" services and related audio, video, and multimedia services.  For example the registrant 
provides development, creation, production and post-production ... for website entertainment content. 
The applicant provides the same services for multimedia entertainment content, which presumably 
encompasses all services of the type described, including registrant's more narrow services.  See, e.g., 
In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. 
Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  In other words, website entertainment 
content is a type of multimedia entertainment content. Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are 
legally identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing 
Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 
(C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball 
Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).  Consequently, the 
applicant provides services that are either highly related or legally identical to the registrant's services. 
 
In conclusion, the marks are confusingly similar and the services are related.  Registration is thus 
refused under Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).
 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  
 
If applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below.
 
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “STUDIOS” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from Merriam-Webster Dictionary shows this wording means:  
2a: a place where motion pictures are made 
b: a company that produces motion pictures 
3: a place maintained and equipped for the transmission of radio or television programs 
4: a place where audio recordings are made 
 
Thus, the wording merely describes applicant’s services because it merely describes the type of 
services and the where the services will be performed.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use STUDIOS” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
