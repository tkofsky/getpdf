NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(e)(1) Merely Descriptive Refusal
•
Identification of Goods
•
 
Section 2(e)(1) Merely Descriptive Refusal
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature, purpose, and/or 
function of applicant’s goods.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP 
§§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
In the present case, the applicant has applied for the mark "SAFE-TEST POINT" in standard characters  
for goods identified as "electrical safety and monitoring devices" in Class 9. 
 
The attached evidence, from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary shows that the wording "SAFE" 
refers to "affording safety or security from danger, risk, or difficulty" or "free from harm or risk", 
"TEST" means "a critical examination, observation, or evaluation", and that the word "POINT" means 
"a particular place". The applicant provides "electrical safety and monitoring devices". Moreover, the 
other attached evidence, from the applicant's own website, shows that the applicant's devices provide 
"qualified workers a safer and more productive way to perform the Absence of Voltage Test (AVT) 
from outside the electrical cabinet". Thus, the each of the individual words, "SAFE", "TEST", and 
"POINT", describe the applicant's goods because the applicant's goods are a particular place or 
"POINT" for electricians to critically examine, monitor, and evaluate an electrical device free from 
harm or risk of electric shock. 
 
Furthermore, even the combined wording, "SAFE-TEST POINT", describes the applicant's goods as 
well. Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to 
the goods and/or services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not 
registrable. In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re 
Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSSMeditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as 
hypodermic, aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 
(TTAB 2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner 
that is an integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services is the combined mark 
registrable. See In re Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial 
Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 
364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
goods and/or services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to 
the goods and/or services. Specifically, the wording "SAFE-TEST POINT" indicates a particular place 
at which one can critically examine, monitor, and evaluate something free from harm or risk. As noted 
above, the applicant's goods allow electricians to safely test electrical equipment free from harm or risk 
at a particular point on the device. In other words, the applicant's goods are, quite literally, a "SAFE-
TEST POINT". 
 
While the wording "SAFE-TEST" has a hyphen in between that wording, that hyphen is also 
insufficient to overcome the descriptive nature of the mark. Adding punctuation marks to a descriptive 
term will not ordinarily change the term into a non-descriptive one. In re Mecca Grade Growers, LLC, 
125 USPQ2d 1950, 1955 (TTAB 2018); TMEP §1209.03(u); see DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro 
Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1253-54, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757-58 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Here, the 
hyphen in between "SAFE" and "TEST" does not change the meaning of the overall wording. 
 
Therefore, for the reasons stated above, the applied-for mark is refused registration under Section 
2(e)(1) for being merely descriptive of the applicant's goods. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
Identification of Goods 
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “Electrical safety and monitoring devices” in the identification of 
goods because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. 
This wording is indefinite because the nature of the goods is unclear, and it is unclear whether "safety" 
and "monitoring" refer to different devices, or whether this wording is meant to describe one device. 
Because of this, this wording could identify goods in more than one international class. For example, 
"electrical safety devices in the nature of LED safety lamps" are in International Class 11, and 
"electrical safety devices in the nature of fuses and resistors for distributing or controlling electric 
current" would be in International Class 09. With all of that being said, because it appears to be the case 
that the applicant is providing electrical current safety-related goods in Class 9, the amended 
identification below takes that into account. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:Class 9: Electrical safety and monitoring devices, namely, [applicant must specify this wording by 
providing the common commercial name of said devices properly classified in Class 9, e.g., 
electronic devices for measuring electric currents, electric monitors for monitoring electric 
current, voltage, and electrical signals, electrical voltage testers]
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.

Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and evidence against the refusal, 
and may have other response options if specified above. For a requirement, applicant should set forth

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
