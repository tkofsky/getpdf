NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF OFFICE’S DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the Office’s database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
REQUIREMENT - IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES
•
REQUIREMENT - DISCLAIMER 
•
 
REQUIREMENT - IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES
 
The identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified because the "delivery" service must 
specify what is actually being delivered, for example, message delivery or food delivery. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. The suggested amendment below substitutes in the expansive but 
definite wording "delivery of goods," however, other amendments narrowing identification would also 
be acceptable. For additional assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in 
trademark applications, please see the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of 
Goods and Services Manual.  See TMEP §1402.04.
 
Applicant should note that any wording in bold, in italics, underlined and/or in ALL CAPS below 
offers guidance and/or shows the changes being proposed for the identification of goods and/or 
services.  If there is wording in the applicant’s version of the identification of goods and/or services 
which should be removed, it will be shown with a line through it such as this: strikethrough.  When 
making its amendments, applicant should enter them in standard font, not in bold, in italics, underlined 
or in ALL CAPS.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 39: Delivery of goods
 
See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.
 
An applicant may only amend an identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to add to or 
broaden the scope of the services.  37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); see TMEP §§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. 
Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
REQUIREMENT - DISCLAIMER
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “DELIVERY” because it is merely descriptive of applicant’s 
services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
This wording is directly set forth within the identification of services submitted with the application 
which simply identifies the services as "delivery." Thus, the wording merely describes that applicant’s 
services are delivery services.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “DELIVERY” apart from the mark as 
shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Response guidelines.  For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action.  For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above.  For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements.  Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
If applicant has questions regarding this Office action, please telephone or e-mail the assigned 
trademark examining attorney.  All relevant e-mail communications will be placed in the official 
application record; however, an e-mail communication will not be accepted as a response to this Office 
action and will not extend the deadline for filing a proper response.  See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.  Further, although the trademark examining attorney may provide 
additional explanation pertaining to the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action, the 
trademark examining attorney may not provide legal advice or statements about applicant’s rights.  See 
TMEP §§705.02, 709.06.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
