Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusal 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 5452279. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark "MAGIC 8 BALL" in standard characters for “headwear; 
bottoms as clothing; tops as clothing” in International Class 25.
 
Registrant’s mark is "8BALL T-SHIRTS" in standard characters for “hooded sweat shirts; hoods; 
sweatshirts; sweatshirts for men, women and children; T-shirts; T-shirts for men, women and children; 
graphic T-shirts; hooded sweatshirts; hooded sweatshirts for men, women and children; short-sleeved 
or long-sleeved T-shirts" in International Class 25. 
 
Similarity of the Mark 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marksconfusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Here, applicant’s mark, "MAGIC 8 BALL", is confusingly similar to the registered mark, "8BALL T-
SHIRTS". 
 
Marks must be compared in their entireties and should not be dissected; however, a trademark 
examining attorney may weigh the individual components of a mark to determine its overall 
commercial impression. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 
(Fed. Cir. 2018) (“[Regarding the issue of confusion,] there is nothing improper in stating that . . . more 
or less weight has been given to a particular feature of a mark, provided the ultimate conclusion rests 
on consideration of the marks in their entireties.” (quoting In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 
224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985)).
 
Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or 
dominant in creating a commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 
USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 
751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or 
generic for a party’s goods and/or services is typically less significant or less dominant when 
comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 
2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 
1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).  Here, registrant has disclaimed "T-SHIRTS", granting this 
portion lesser analytical weight.  Accordingly, the dominant portion of registrant's mark is "8BALL". 
 
Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of 
terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See 
Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), 
aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 
1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH 
confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM 
and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-
(iii).  Moreover, marks that are identical but for the presence or absence of a space between terms have 
been held confusingly similar.  See, e.g., Seaguard Corp. v. Seaward Int’l, Inc., 223 USPQ 48, 51 
(TTAB 1984) (“[T]he marks ‘SEAGUARD’ and ‘SEA GUARD’ are, in contemplation of law, identical 
[internal citation omitted].”); In re Best W. Family Steak House, Inc., 222 USPQ 827, 827 (TTAB 
1984) (“There can be little doubt that the marks [BEEFMASTER and BEEF MASTER] are practically 
identical”); Stock Pot, Inc., v. Stockpot Rest., Inc., 220 USPQ 52, 52 (TTAB 1983), aff’d 737 F.2d 
1576, 222 USPQ 665 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (“There is no question that the marks of the parties [STOCKPOT 
and STOCK POT] are confusingly similar. The word marks are phonetically identical and visually 
almost identical.”).  In this case, registrant's dominant portion "8BALL" is functionally equivalent to "8 
BALL" for likelihood of confusion purposes.  Applicant's mark, "MAGIC 8 BALL", therefore 
encompasses the functional equivalent of the dominant portion of registrant's mark. As such, the 
portions of these marks are identical in sound and virtually identical in appearance. 
 
Applicant's addition of "MAGIC" to "8 BALL" does not meaningfully detract from this 
similarity.  Adding a term to a registered mark generally does not obviate the similarity between the 
compared marks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section2(d). See Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 
106 (C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL and BENGAL LANCER and design confusingly similar); In 
re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1269 (TTAB 2009) (holding TITAN and VANTAGE 
TITAN confusingly similar); In re El Torito Rests., Inc., 9 USPQ2d 2002, 2004 (TTAB 1988) (holding 
MACHO and MACHO COMBOS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii). In the present case, 
the marks are functionally identical in part.   
 
Because the functional equivalent of the dominant portion of registrant's mark is encompassed by 
applicant's mark, and because applicant and registrant's differing additional matter is granted lesser 
analytical weight, the marks are considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.
 
Relatedness of the Goods
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods stated in the application 
and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 
F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 
1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the application uses broad wording to describe "headwear [and] tops as clothing", which 
presumably encompasses all goods of the type described, including registrant’s more narrow "hooded 
sweat shirts; hoods; sweatshirts; sweatshirts for men, women and children; T-shirts; T-shirts for men, 
women and children; graphic T-shirts; hooded sweatshirts; hooded sweatshirts for men, women and 
children; short-sleeved or long-sleeved T-shirts."  See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 
1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 
2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 
127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 
648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 
USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 
1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).  
 
Neither the application nor the registration contains any limitations regarding trade channels for the 
goods and therefore it is assumed that registrant’s and applicant’s goods are sold everywhere that is 
normal for such items, i.e., clothing and department stores. Thus, it can also be assumed that the same 
classes of purchasers shop for these items and that consumers are accustomed to seeing them sold under 
the same or similar marks. See Kangol Ltd. v. KangaROOS U.S.A., Inc., 974 F.2d 161, 23 USPQ2d 
1945 (Fed. Cir. 1992); In re Smith & Mehaffey, 31 USPQ2d 1531 (TTAB 1994); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(iii). 
 
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are related. 
 
Conclusion
 
Where the goods and/or services of an applicant and registrant are “similar in kind and/or closely 
related,” the degree of similarity between the marks required to support a finding of likelihood of 
confusion is not as great as in the case of diverse goods and/or services.  In re J.M. Originals Inc., 6 
USPQ2d 1393, 1394 (TTAB 1987); see Shen Mfg. Co. v. Ritz Hotel Ltd., 393 F.3d 1238, 1242, 73 
USPQ2d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2004); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods are legally identical, there is a likelihood of confusion asto the source of applicant’s goods, and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Trademark 
Act.
