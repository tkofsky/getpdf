NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue datebelow or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 27, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
    A.    Section 2(d) Refusal -- Likelihood of Confusion  
    B.    Prior-Filed Application May Bar Registration  
    C.    Improper Disclaimer -- Advisory 
 
A.    SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL -- LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 6244995. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark PRAY GIRL in standard characters for "Religious and 
spiritual services, namely, providing gatherings and retreats to develop and enhance the spiritual lives 
of individuals" in International Class 45. 
 
Registrant's mark is PREACHGIRL! in standard characters for "Educational services, namely, 
conducting online classes, seminars, conferences, workshops in the field of empowering women in 
business, ministry and non-profit development and distribution of training material in connection 
therewith" in International Class 41.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] anddifferences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Considering the marks in their entireties, applicant's mark PRAY GIRL and registrant's mark 
PREACHGIRL! are similar in structure, meaning, and commercial impression. Each mark comprises a 
short verb that begins with the letter "P", followed by the identical term "GIRL." 
 
Moreover, both marks stimulate a similar mental reaction. Consumer confusion has been held likely for 
marks that do not physically sound or look alike but that convey the same idea, stimulate the same 
mental reaction, or may have the same overall meaning. Proctor & Gamble Co. v. Conway, 419 F.2d 
1332, 1336, 164 USPQ 301, 304 (C.C.P.A. 1970) (holding MISTER STAIN likely to be confused with 
MR. CLEAN on competing cleaning products); see In re M. Serman & Co., 223 USPQ 52, 53 (TTAB 
1984) (holding CITY WOMAN for ladies’ blouses likely to be confused with CITY GIRL for a variety 
of female clothing); H. Sichel Sohne, GmbH v. John Gross & Co., 204 USPQ 257, 260-61 (TTAB 
1979) (holding BLUE NUN for wines likely to be confused with BLUE CHAPEL for the same goods); 
Ralston Purina Co. v. Old Ranchers Canning Co., 199 USPQ 125, 128 (TTAB 1978) (holding TUNA 
O’ THE FARM for canned chicken likely to be confused with CHICKEN OF THE SEA for canned 
tuna); Downtowner Corp. v. Uptowner Inns, Inc., 178 USPQ 105, 109 (TTAB 1973) (holding 
UPTOWNER for motor inn and restaurant services likely to be confused with DOWNTOWNER for 
the same services); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
As pertinent here, the word "PRAY" means "to utter or address a prayer or prayers to a deity or an 
object of worship, often as an entreaty" or "to make a devout or earnest request for." The word 
"PREACH" means "to proclaim or put forth in a sermon" or "to advocate, especially to urge acceptance 
of or compliance with." See attached definitions from American Heritage Dictionary. Thus, the marks 
convey similar overall impressions. The source-identifying essence of both marks is an exhortation to 
take religious action. 
 
The trademark examining attorney notes that registrant's mark is presented as a compound term instead 
of as two words (like applicant's mark). However, this distinction does not detract significantly from 
the overall similarity of the marks for likelihood of confusion purposes. See, e.g., Seaguard Corp. v. 
Seaward Int’l, Inc., 223 USPQ 48, 51 (TTAB 1984) (“[T]he marks ‘SEAGUARD’ and ‘SEA GUARD’ 
are, in contemplation of law, identical [internal citation omitted].”); In re Best W. Family Steak House, 
Inc., 222 USPQ 827, 827 (TTAB 1984) (“There can be little doubt that the marks [BEEFMASTER and 
BEEF MASTER] are practically identical”); Stock Pot, Inc., v. Stockpot Rest., Inc., 220 USPQ 52, 52 
(TTAB 1983), aff’d 737 F.2d 1576, 222 USPQ 665 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (“There is no question that the 
marks of the parties [STOCKPOT and STOCK POT] are confusingly similar. The word marks are 
phonetically identical and visually almost identical.”).Similarly, the exclamation point in registrant's mark is unlikely to avoid confusion. Punctuation is 
generally not sufficient to alter the connotation and overall commercial impression of otherwise 
confusingly similar marks and, as such, is not sufficient to distinguish marks. See, e.g., In re St. Helena 
Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1084-85 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (finding punctuation in 
registrant’s mark, TAKE 10!, did not alter the pronunciation or distinguish it in any significant way 
from applicant’s mark, TAKETEN); Mini Melts, Inc. v. Reckitt Benckiser LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1464, 
1470 (TTAB 2016) (finding “the hyphen in [a]pplicant’s mark MINI-MELTS [did] not distinguish it 
from [o]pposer’s mark [MINI MELTS]”); Mag Instrument Inc. v. Brinkmann Corp., 96 USPQ2d 1701, 
1712 (TTAB 2010) (citing Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Dayco Corp., 201 USPQ 485, 488 n.1 
(TTAB 1978)) (finding hyphen did not distinguish opposer’s mark, MAG-NUM STAR, from 
applicant’s mark, MAGNUM MAXFIRE).
 
Because applicant's and registrant's marks share a similar structure and convey an overall similar 
commercial impression, the marks are considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.
 
Relatedness of the Services
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
In this case, applicant's and registrant's services are related in that the application and registration both 
list types of gatherings that encourage personal development. Applicant's and registrant's services are 
thus similar in nature.
 
Applicant's and registrant's services are also considered related for Section 2(d) purposes because the 
same entity frequently provides services similar to applicant's and registrant's under the same mark. 
This makes confusion likely where, as here, similar marks for the services are used in connection with 
different entities.
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of website excerpts from Focusing Ahead, Intuitive Business 
Academy, and Western Spirit Ranch, establishes that the same entity commonly provides (1) spiritual 
gatherings and retreats similar to applicant's and (2) classes and workshops similar to registrant's, and 
markets the services under the same mark.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are considered 
related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 
1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 
2009).
 
ConclusionBecause applicant's and registrant's marks are similar and the services associated with the marks are 
related, there is a likelihood of confusion as to the source of applicant's services. Therefore, applicant's 
mark is not entitled to registration. 
 
Applicant should note the following potential additional ground for refusal.
 
B.    PRIOR-FILED APPLICATION MAY BAR REGISTRATION 
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 97083188 (THAT PRAYER GIRL) precedes 
applicant’s filing date.  See attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application 
registers, applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a 
likelihood of confusion between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP 
§§1208 et seq.  Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this 
application may be suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
C.    IMPROPER DISCLAIMER -- ADVISORY 
 
Applicant has disclaimed the entire applied-for mark; however, an entire mark may not be disclaimed. 
TMEP §1213.06; see 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Dena Corp. v. Belvedere Int’l Inc., 950 F.2d 1555, 
1560, 21 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 1991); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 n.1 
(TTAB 2001). If the applied-for mark is not registrable as a whole, a disclaimer will not make it 
registrable. TMEP §1213.06. In this case, the applied-for mark appears to constitute a unitary 
expression such that no disclaimer of either term is required. Accordingly, the disclaimer is not 
accepted and will not be entered into the USPTO’s database. See TMEP §714.05(a).
