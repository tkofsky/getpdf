NONFINAL OFFICE ACTIONThe USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(d) Refusal
 
•
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 6312419. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Here, applicant’s mark is "G" (and design) for "Real estate title insurance underwriting services" and 
"Real estate closing services."
 
The cited registration is "G" (and design) for “Home warranty services, namely, arranging for repairs 
and replacement of major home systems, appliances and parts thereof provided by others pursuant to 
service agreements..”
 
Comparison of the MarksMarks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When evaluating a composite mark consisting of letters and a design, the letter portion is normally 
accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be 
remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods and/or services. In re 
Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks 
must be compared in their entireties, the letter portion is often considered the dominant feature and is 
accorded greater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word 
portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant 
Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 
1983)). Accordingly, the letter "G" is considered the dominant portion of each mark, despite the 
presence of design elements.  
 
In this case, the marks are similar in appearance because the dominant portion of each mark is the letter 
"G". Moreover, the presentation of the letter "G" is highly similar in each mark because each "G" is 
specifically formed in the shape of a structure having sharp corners and a peaked roof. Minor 
differences with respect to the relative shape of the roof portion of the "G" in each mark are not 
sufficient to obviate the similarity of the marks. In addition, the circle included in the registrant's mark 
is an ordinary geometric shape that services as background, and is not sufficiently distinctive to change 
the commercial impression of the mark. See In re Dixie Rests. Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 
1534 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (stating that the diamond shape around the mark is not sufficiently distinctive to 
change the commercial impression conveyed by the mark); In re Kysela Pere et Fils Ltd., 98 USPQ2d 
1261, 1267 (TTAB 2011) (“And certainly the oval designs in the marks are merely background . . . and 
do not make a strong commercial impression.”) (citation omitted). In addition, the connotation and 
commercial impression of the marks do not differ when considered in connection with applicant’s and 
registrant’s respective services. 
 
Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar.   
 
Comparison of the Services
 
The compared services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the services] emanate from 
the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 
1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 
2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots from third party websites, establishes that the 
same entity commonly provides the relevant services and markets the services under the same mark. In 
particular, the attached screenshots from First American, Stewart, and AmTrust all show the same 
entity offering real estate title insurance underwriting services and real estate closing services along 
with home warranty services, all under the same mark. Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are 
considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 
USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 
1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Thus, upon encountering applicant’s and registrant’s marks, consumers are likely to be confused and 
mistakenly believe that the respective services emanate from a common source.  Accordingly, 
applicant’s mark must be refused under Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.

have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
