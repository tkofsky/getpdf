NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 28, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
    A.    Specimen Refusal -- Website Displays Are Not Point-of-Sale in Nature for Classes 8, 9, and 10
    B.    Amended Identification of Goods and Services Required 
    C.    Multiple-Class Application Requirements 
    D.    Disclaimer Required 
    E.    Amended Mark Description Required 
 
A.    SPECIMEN REFUSAL -- WEBSITE DISPLAYS ARE NOT POINT-OF-SALE IN 
NATURE FOR CLASSES 8, 9, AND 10
 
This refusal applies to Classes 8, 9, and 10 and does not bar registration in the other class.
 
Specimen is not an acceptable webpage display. Registration is refused because the specimen in 
International Classes 8, 9, and 10 is not acceptable as a display associated with the goods and does not 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §2.56(a), (b)(1); see TMEP §§904, 904.03(g)-(i), 904.07(a). An application 
based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as 
actually used in commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a).
 
A webpage or catalog display specimen (1) must show use of the mark directly associated with the 
goods and (2) such use must be of a point-of-sale nature. 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1). This means that this 
type of display specimen must include the following:
 
(1)      A picture or sufficient textual description of the goods;
 
(2)      The mark associated with the goods; and
 
(3)      A means for ordering the goods such as a “shopping cart” button/link, an 
order form, or a telephone number for placing orders.
 
See In re Sones, 590 F.3d 1282, 1286-89, 93 USPQ2d 1118, 1122-24 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re Azteca 
Sys., Inc., 102 USPQ2d 1955, 1957-58 (TTAB 2012); In re Dell Inc., 71 USPQ2d 1725, 1727 (TTAB 
2004); Lands’ End v. Manbeck, 797 F. Supp. 511, 514, 24 USPQ2d 1314, 1316 (E.D. Va. 1992); 
TMEP §904.03(h), (i)-.03(i)(D).
 
In this case, the specimen does not show sufficient means for ordering the goods. Specifically, while 
the specimens show the applied-for mark and various goods, the specimens do not show any means by 
which consumers may immediately consummate a purchase of the goods, such as a "shopping cart" 
button/link, "Add to Cart" button, or "Buy Now" button.Accordingly, such material is mere advertising, which is not acceptable as a specimen for goods. See In 
re Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 265039, at *15-16 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re Siny Corp., 
920 F.3d 1331, 1336, 2019 USPQ2d 127099, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. 2019)); see also Avakoff v. S. Pac. Co., 
765 F.2d 1097, 1098, 226 USPQ 435, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §904.04(b), (c).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  As specified above, a webpage specimen submitted as a display associated 
with the goods must show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and 
include information necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), 
(c).  Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL 
and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the 
specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed 
response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
ADVISORY -- APPLICANT'S OPTIONS WHEN REFUSAL APPLIES TO SPECIFIC CLASSES
 
The stated refusal applies to Classes 8, 9, and 10 and does not bar registration in the other class.
 
Applicant may respond to the stated refusal by submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal.  
In addition, applicant may respond by doing one of the following:
 
(1)  Deleting the classes to which the refusal pertains;
 
(2)  Filing a Request to Divide Application form (form #3) to divide out the services that havenot been refused registration, so that the mark may proceed toward publication for opposition in 
the class to which the refusal does not pertain.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.87.  See generally TMEP 
§§1110 et seq. (regarding the requirements for filing a request to divide).  If applicant files a 
request to divide, then to avoid abandonment, applicant must also file a timely response to all 
outstanding issues in this Office action, including the refusal.  37 C.F.R. §2.87(e).; or
 
(3)  Amending the basis for such classes, if appropriate.  TMEP §806.03(h).  (The basis cannot 
be changed for applications filed under Trademark Act Section 66(a).  TMEP §1904.01(a).)
 
If applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below.
 
B.    AMENDED IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES REQUIRED
 
A written application must specify the particular goods and/or services on or in connection with which 
the applicant uses, or has a bona fide intention to use, the mark in commerce. 15 U.S.C. §§1051(a)(2), 
1051(b)(2); 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6). To “specify” means to name in an explicit manner. TMEP §1402.01. 
An identification that fails to identify the goods and services with specificity is indefinite, either 
because the nature of the goods or services is not clear or because the wording is so broad that it may 
include goods or services in more than one class. Id. The applicant must identify the goods and services 
specifically to provide public notice and to enable the USPTO to classify the goods and services 
properly and to reach informed judgments concerning likelihood of confusion under 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d). Id.
 
International Class 8
 
In this case, the entry for "tools for use in the field of metalworking by hobbyists" in International Class 
8 is indefinite and too broad. This wording is indefinite because it does not clearly describe applicant's 
goods. In addition, this wording could identify goods in more than one international class. Class 8 
includes hand-operated tools and implements. Motor-driven tools, such as power tools, are usually in 
Class 7. Thus, because a "tool for use in the field of metalworking by hobbyists" may be motor-driven 
or hand-operated, this wording by itself is not sufficient to ensure proper classification. Applicant must 
identify the particular tools using their common commercial or generic name. If the tool has no 
common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the tool(s), its main purpose, and its 
intended uses.   
 
International Class 9
 
The entry for "tools for use in the field of jewelry" in International Class 9 is indefinite. Applicant must 
specify the particular tools in Class 9 that it provides, using their common commercial or generic name. 
If the tool has no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the tool(s), its main 
purpose, and its intended uses.  
 
International Class 10
 
Similarly, the entry for "tools for use in the fields of dentistry, podiatry, and pedicure" is indefinite. 
Applicant must specify the particular tools in Class 10 that it provides, using their common commercial 
or generic name. If the tool has no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the 
tool(s), its main purpose, and its intended uses.International Class 35
 
The entries for "distributorship services in the fields of jeweler tools and equipment; dental tools and 
equipment; podiatry tools and equipment; pedicure tools and equipment; and hobbyist tools and 
equipment" are indefinite because it appears that applicant has incorrectly used semicolons instead of 
commas to separate the various fields of its distributorship services.  
 
Applicant must correct the punctuation in the identification to clarify the individual items in the list of 
services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01(a). Proper punctuation in identifications is 
necessary to delineate explicitly each product or service within a list and to avoid ambiguity. In general, 
commas should be used in an identification (1) to separate a series of related items identified within a 
particular category of goods or services, (2) before and after “namely,” and (3) between each item in a 
list of goods or services following “namely” (e.g., personal care products, namely, body lotion, bar 
soap, shampoo). Id. Semicolons generally should be used to separate a series of distinct categories of 
goods or services within an international class (e.g., personal care products, namely, body lotion; 
deodorizers for pets; glass cleaners). Id.
 
Thus, applicant should replace the semicolons in this entry with commas, if appropriate.
 
For each instance requiring additional clarification, the examining attorney has provided an example of 
an acceptable amendment (or the format therefor) below.  If the suggestions below are not accurate, 
applicant is encouraged to use the USPTO’s online Identification Manual (see ID Manual link below) 
to search for acceptable wording to properly identify the intended goods and services.
 
EXAMPLE IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES:  The following is an example of an 
acceptable identification of goods and services that applicant may adopt, if accurate (additions in bold).
 
Class 7
 
Power-operated tools for use in the field of metalworking by hobbyists, namely, {specify the 
particular power tools in Class 7, e.g., bits for power drills} 
 
Class 8
 
Hand-operated tools for use in the field of metalworking by hobbyists, namely, {specify the 
particular hand-operated tools in Class 8, e.g., files being hand-operated tools for smoothing 
surfaces of metal} 
 
Class 9
 
Tools for use in the field of jewelry, namely, {specify the particular tools in Class 9, e.g., 
jewelers loupes} 
 
Class 10  
 
Tools for use in the fields of dentistry, podiatry, and pedicure, namely, {specify the particular 
tools in Class 10, e.g., dental burs}Class 35 
 
Distributorship services in the fields of jeweler tools and equipment, dental tools and 
equipment, podiatry tools and equipment, pedicure tools and equipment, and hobbyist tools and 
equipment 
 
NOTE:  Where brackets and bracketed guidance appear in the above example, input from applicant is 
required.  Any amendments proposed by applicant in response to the requirement for an acceptable 
identification of goods and/or services must not contain brackets.  
 
SCOPE ADVISORY:  Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or 
services, but not to broaden or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06.  Generally, any 
deleted goods and/or services may not later be reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
ONLINE ID MANUAL:  For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in 
trademark applications, please see the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of 
Goods and Services Manual.  See TMEP §1402.04.
 
For information on how to identify the goods and services in an application, applicant is encouraged to 
view the USPTO’s Trademark Information Network Video Number 6, “Goods and Services.”
 
C.    MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
 
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the 
fees already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods and services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least five 
classes; however, applicant submitted fees sufficient for only four classes. Applicant must 
either (a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) 
restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for Class 35; and applicant needs a specimen for Classes 7, 8, 9, and 10. See 
more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated withthe goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or 
advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce 
on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as 
early as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(a) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
D.    DISCLAIMER REQUIRED 
 
Applicant must disclaim the word “PRODUCT” because it is merely descriptive of a characteristic of 
applicant’s goods and services.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. 
Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 
1213.03(a). 
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove the 
disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.
 
The word "PRODUCT" in the applied for mark means "an item that is made or refined and marketed: 
farm products; soaps, detergents, and similar products." See attached definition from American 
Heritage Dictionary.
 
The application identifies applicant's goods as various tools and distributorship services in the field of 
tools.
 
Thus, the word "PRODUCT" merely describes a characteristic of applicant's goods and services 
because applicant's tools are made or refined and marketed, and applicant's distributorship services 
feature tools that are made or refined and marketed.Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “PRODUCT” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire mark. 
See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1041, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005); TMEP 
§1213.01(b).
 
E.    AMENDED MARK DESCRIPTION REQUIRED
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one is incomplete and 
does not describe all the significant aspects of the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 808.02. 
Descriptions must be accurate and identify all the literal and design elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.37; TMEP §§808 et seq.
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate: The mark consists of a stylized design of a bur 
head shape inside a single-line circle, which is surrounded by a shaded, incomplete circle with 
breaks at the left and right sides. The wording "A PFINGST" appears in the top portion of the 
shaded, incomplete circle, and the word "PRODUCT" appears in the bottom portion of the 
shaded, incomplete circle. Several small dots appear in the center of the bur head shape, forming 
incomplete circles and having the appearance of a spiral.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
