NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.Summary of Issues
 
Prior-Filed Application(s)
•
Identification Of Goods and Services Requires Amendment
•
 
Prior-Filed Application(s)
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting registered marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 
2(d). 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02. However, a mark in a prior-filed pending application may 
present a bar to registration of applicant’s mark.
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 90741657 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues. 
 
Applicant applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
Identification Of Goods and Services Requires Amendment
 
The wording in the identification of goods and services is indefinite and must be clarified.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. 
 
The applicant insufficiently describes the following goods and services:
 
Class 9
 
The wording “non-fungible tokens” identifications are indefinite because the specific asset must 
be specified and further indicated to be downloadable, and further non-fungible tokens represent 
specific digital items and merely authenticate their ownership.  The identification of goods must 
be amended to reflect that.
•
 
Class 35
 
The Class 35 services are confusingly drafted, as it is not clear what this service is providing 
exactly.
•
 
Class 41
 
Some of the Class 41 entertainment services are confusingly drafted as it is not clear what 
entertainment service is being provided.
•If accurate, and inserting specific information where directed, the applicant may adopt any or all of the 
following identifications of goods and services.  Additions are in bold.  See TMEP §1402.01.
 
Class 9: Downloadable assets, namely, [indicate specific asset here, e.g., multimedia file 
containing artwork, text, audio, and video relating to {indicate field or subject matter of 
file}] authenticated by non-fungible tokens (NFTs); Digital collectible item, namely,  [indicate 
specific asset here, e.g., multimedia file containing artwork, text, audio, and video relating 
to {indicate field or subject matter of file}] authenticated by non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
•
 
Class 35:  Provision of an online marketplace for buyers and sellers of downloadable digital 
{indicate type of downloadable digital goods, e.g., art images, music, video clips, etc.} 
authenticated by non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
•
 
Class 41: Entertainment services, namely, providing artwork and interactive artwork for viewing, 
said artwork authenticated by digital non-fungible tokens;  entertainment services in the nature 
of providing online, non-downloadable virtual goods, namely, digital collectible artworks 
authenticated by non-fungible tokens;  entertainment services, namely, production and 
distribution of ongoing digital programs and motion pictures for distribution by television, the 
Internet and social media, featuring characters based on digital art and non-fungible tokens 
(NFTs);  providing a website featuring non-downloadable videos and digital programs and 
motion pictures featuring characters based on digital art and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)

For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e) 
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
