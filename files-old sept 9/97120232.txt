NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marksand has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
 
Digitally created or altered image or mockup is not an acceptable specimen. Registration is refused 
because the specimen appears to consist of a mock-up  and does not show the applied-for mark as 
actually used in commerce in International Class(es) 9.  Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (c); TMEP §§904.04(a)(iii), 904.07(a). 
 
An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for 
mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a).  “Use in commerce” means (1) a bona fide use of the applied-for mark in the ordinary course 
of trade (and not merely to reserve a right in the mark), (2) the mark is placed in any manner on the 
goods, packaging, tags or labels affixed to the goods, or displays that directly associate the mark with 
the goods and have a point-of-sale nature, and (3) the goods are actually sold or transported in 
commerce.  See 15 U.S.C. §1127.
 
An electronic display or webpage that has been digitally created or altered to include the mark or a 
mockup of how the mark may be displayed on the electronic display or webpage is not a proper 
specimen for goods because it does not show actual use of the mark in commerce.  See 15 U.S.C. 
§1127; 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §904.04(a)(i).
 
In this case, Applicant's specimen appears to have been created just for purposes of obtaining a 
Trademark Registration and not for legitimate usage in commerce. This is demonstrated by the 
uncharacteristically sloppy placement of the mark on the goods, the overall poor presentation of the 
goods, and the website associated with the goods which is completely lacking in any 
functionality. Therefore the specimen does not show actual use of the mark in commerce. 
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to the specimen refusal by satisfying one of the following 
options for each applicable international class:
 
(1)               Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement. For 
instructions on how to submit a different specimen using the online Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen webpage.
 
Applicants submitting a webpage as a specimen for goods must include the URL and the 
date the page was accessed or printed either directly on the specimen itself or in a separate 
statement, supported by an affidavit or declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 verifying such 
information. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
If applicant submits an acceptable verified substitute specimen or amends to Section 1(b), the 
requirement below for additional information/documentation about the original specimen will be 
withdrawn. The requirement below as to the original specimen will be made final if applicant submits a 
substitute specimen that is not acceptable or does not amend to Section 1(b), and does not also respond 
completely to the requirement below.
 
Additional information/documentation about original specimen(s) required. To permit proper 
examination of the application record for compliance with use in commerce requirements, applicant 
must respond to the following requirement for information and documentation about the specimen(s). 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§814, 904.04(a)(iii). A specimen must show the mark as actually used 
in commerce, which means use in the ordinary course of trade, and not merely to reserve a right in the 
trademark. 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1052, 1127. Because the specimen of record appears to be digitally 
created or altered, or is a mockup, further information is necessary to determine whether the specimen 
is in actual use in commerce. 
 
Answer for each specimen/photograph/image previously provided. For any website source, 
applicant must provide (1) an image of the webpage, (2) the date it was accessed or printed, and (3) the 
complete URL address. In re ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (TTAB 2020) 
(citing In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018)); TMEP §710.01(b). Providing only a 
website address or hyperlink to the webpage is not sufficient to make the materials of record. In re 
ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (citing In re Olin Corp., 124 USPQ2d 1327, 
1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB Solomon Assocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); 
TBMP §1208.03); TMEP §814.
 
(1)        Identify the particular good(s) listed in the application for which the 
specimen(s) was submitted to show use of the mark.
 
(2)        Explain whether the specimen was created for submission with this 
application. If so, specify the date each specimen was created. If applicant obtained the 
content of the webpage or image(s) of the goods shown in the specimen(s) from a third-
party website, provide the URL of the website and a digital copy of relevant webpage(s) 
for each image.
 
(3)        For each web-based specimen submission, provide the full name of the 
online retailer or wholesaler whose webpage is shown in the specimen, the website URL, 
the access or print date, and a digital copy of the complete webpage showing the goods for 
sale on the named website.
 
(4)        For each online retailer or wholesaler identified in response to question (3), 
specify the date the goods bearing the mark were first available for purchase within the 
United States, the date of the first sale of the goods to or within the United States through 
that retailer/wholesaler, and whether the goods are still for sale to or within the United 
States through that retailer/wholesaler. If applicant is the online retailer or wholesaler, 
provide at least three invoices or other supporting documentation that show payments orother consideration made and state the dollar amount of sales with or within the United 
States, redacting personal or private information of buyers as necessary.
 
(5)        If the goods identified in response to question (1) are sold in another type of 
sales environment, identify the environment (e.g. retail stores, catalogs, trade shows) and 
provide photographs and/or documentation showing the goods for sale with the mark in 
that environment, such as photographs of the sales displays or goods on shelves. If the 
information about how the goods appear in the actual sales environment is not available to 
applicant, describe how applicant’s goods are sold or transported to or within the United 
States and provide photographs and other documentation showing how applicant’s mark 
appears on the goods and/or its packaging when the goods are sold or transported to or 
within the United States.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
 
 
 
Specimen requirement.
Applicant has applied for a multitude of goods in International Class 9.  Note that if an identification is 
so broad that it encompasses a wide range of products and services, the applicant must submit evidence 
that it actually uses the mark on a wide range of products and services to obtain registration.  See In re 
Air Products & Chemicals, Inc., 192 USPQ 84, recon. denied 192 USPQ 157 (TTAB 1976); 37 CFR 
2.61(b); TMEP §§904.01(a) and 1402.03.
Applicant should submit specimens demonstrating use of the mark on all of the following goods:
 
    Batteries and battery chargers; Battery chargers; Battery chargers for home video game machines; 
Chargers for batteries; Chargers for electric batteries; Charging appliances for rechargeable equipment; 
Electric storage batteries; Electrical cells and batteries; Electrical gang boxes; Electrical receptacles; 
Life jackets for pets; Rangefinders for golf; Rechargeable batteries; Rechargers for electric 
accumulators; Warning flags
 
Please note that for every specimen submitted, applicant must clearly provide the common commercial 
name for the goods to which such specimen relates in order to permit proper examination of the goods.
If applicant is unable to provide specimens to support use of these items, applicant must delete these 
entries, or amend the filing basis for those goods that were not in proper use as of the application filing 
date to an intent to use basis under Section 1(b). This option will later necessitate additional fees and 
filing requirements such as providing a specimen for these goods at a subsequent date.
To submit a verified specimen or verified substitute specimen online using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form, (1) answer “Yes” to form wizard question #2; and then, 
continuing on to the next portion of the form, under the heading “Classification and Listing of 
Goods/Services/Collective Membership Organization,” do the following for each relevant class for 
which a specimen is being submitted: (2) check the box next to the following statement: “Check here to 
modify the current classification number; listing of goods/services/the nature of the collectivemembership organization; dates of use; and/or filing basis; or to submit a substitute specimen, a foreign 
registration certificate, or proof of renewal of a foreign registration. If not checked, the changes will be 
ignored.”; (3) under “Specimen File,” attach a specimen (attachment may not exceed 5 megabytes); (4) 
describe in the box below where you attached the file what the specimen consists of; and (5) check the 
box next to the following statement below the specimen description (to ensure that the declaration 
language is inserted into the form): “The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) 
specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application”. 
Additionally, when submitting a verified specimen, the TEAS online form requires two signatures: one 
in the “Declaration Signature” section and one in the “Response Signature” section.
Failure to comply with a request to furnish additional specimens is grounds for refusing registration. In 
re Harley, 119 USPQ2d 1755, 1757-58 (TTAB 2016); TMEP §814. Merely stating that evidence is 
available on applicant’s or a third party website is an insufficient response and will not make the 
additional specimens of record. See In re Planalytics, Inc., 70 USPQ2d 1453, 1457-58 (TTAB 2004).

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
