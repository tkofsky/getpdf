NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Informational Refusal
•
 
•
 
INFORMATIONAL REFUSAL
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is a slogan or term that does not function as a 
trademark or service mark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and/or services and to identify 
and distinguish them from others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, 3, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1053, 
1127. In this case, the applied-for mark is a commonplace term, message, or expression widely used by 
a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment. 
See In re Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 129 USPQ2d 1148, 1160 (TTAB 2019) (holding INVESTING IN 
AMERICAN JOBS not registrable for retail store services or promoting public awareness of goods 
made or assembled by American workers because the mark would be perceived merely as a commonly-
used informational message); In re Volvo Cars of N. Am., Inc., 46 USPQ2d 1455, 1460-61 (TTAB 
1998) (holding DRIVE SAFELY not registrable for automobiles and automobile parts because the 
mark would be perceived merely as an “everyday, commonplace safety admonition”).
 
Terms and expressions that merely convey an informational message are not registrable. In re 
DePorter, 129 USPQ2d 1298, 1299 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Eagle Crest, Inc., 96 USPQ2d 1227, 
1229 (TTAB 2010)). Determining whether the term or expression functions as a trademark or service 
mark depends on how it would be perceived by the relevant public. Univ. of Ky. v. 40-0, LLC, 2021USPQ2d 253, at *25 (TTAB 2021) (citing In re Greenwood, 2020 USPQ2d 11439, at *2 (TTAB 
2020)); In re DePorter, 129 USPQ2d at 1303 (quoting In re Eagle Crest, Inc., 96 USPQ2d at 1229)); 
TMEP §1202.04. “The more commonly a term or expression is used, the less likely that the public will 
use it to identify only one source and the less likely that it will be recognized by purchasers as a 
trademark [or service mark].” In re Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *3 (TTAB 2019) 
(citing In re Hulting, 107 USPQ2d 1175, 1177 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §1202.04(b).
 
The attached evidence from the internet shows that this term or expression is commonly used in the 
foster care industry and conveys the idea that anyone can BE THE VILLAGE necessary to assist a 
child in the foster care system. Because consumers are accustomed to seeing this term or expression 
commonly used in everyday speech by many different sources, they would not perceive it as a mark 
identifying the source of applicant’s goods and/or services but rather as only conveying an 
informational message.
 
BE THE VILLAGE is a derivative of the popular African Proverb "it takes a village," which refers to 
the collective resources of a family and community that are necessary to raise a child. See attached 
definition from the website reference.com. 
 
The phrase BE THE VILLAGE is directed to individuals who immediately understand that the slogan 
is a variation of the African proverb, as such the potential donor is moved to donate and thereby 
become a part of the village.
 
Accordingly, the slogan BE THE VILLAGE is commonly used in the field of foster care/adoption to 
convey the message to members of the public that they can be a part of the solution to the problems in 
the lives of children in the foster care system.
 
The attached evidence from various internet websites shows that BE THE VILLAGE is commonly 
used by those in the foster care field as a promotional phrase. Because consumers are accustomed to 
seeing BE THE VILLAGE used in this manner, when BE THE VILLAGE is applied to applicant's 
services, they would perceive it merely as informational matter indicating that the applicant is 
encouraging the public to BE THE VILLAGE by fostering a child. Thus, this slogan would not be 
perceived as a mark that identifies the source of applicant's services.
 
Additional attachments from third party websites show that the applied-for mark itself, BE THE 
VILLAGE, has been used as a promotional phrase for various services in the foster care industry. 
Accordingly, as shown by the attached evidence, consumers would perceive BE THE VILLAGE 
merely as an informational statement rather than a trademark identifying the source of the applicant’s 
procurement and distribution to foster parents of in-kind donations or promoting public awareness of 
foster parenting.
 
An applicant may not overcome this refusal by amending the application to seek registration on the 
Supplemental Register or asserting a claim of acquired distinctiveness under Section 2(f). In re Ocean 
Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *8; TMEP §1202.04(d); see In re TracFone Wireless, Inc., 2019 
USPQ2d 222983, at *4 (TTAB 2019). Nor will submitting a substitute specimen overcome this refusal. 
In re Team Jesus LLC, 2020 USPQ2d 11489, at *5-6 (TTAB 2020) (quoting D.C. One Wholesaler, Inc. 
v. Chien, 120 USPQ2d 1710, 1716 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1202.04(d).

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
