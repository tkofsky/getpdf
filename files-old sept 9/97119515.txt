*    *    *    *    *The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03. 
 
 
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS (Advisory)  
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
 
 
Applicant must respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
 
  
RULE 2.61(B) REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL SPECIMEN SUBMISSIONS
THIS PARTIAL REQUIREMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE GOODS SPECIFIED THEREIN: 
  Bicycle safety lights; Computer mice; Computer mouse in the nature of a trackpad; Electronic timers; 
Electronic weighing scales for kitchen use; Navigation apparatus for vehicles in the nature of on-board 
computers;  Remote controls for radios, televisions, stereos; Smartwatch straps; Wireless computer 
mice; Wireless headsets for smartphones.   
  
 
Given the wide variety and range of unrelated goods that applicant has listed in the application, 
applicant must submit additional specimens to allow for a complete and accurate examination of the 
application and assessment of the registrability of the subject mark, in accordance with Rule 2.61(b). 
 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); see TMEP §904.01(a).  Applicant should ensure that its specimens reflect use of 
the mark with each of the following 9 groups of goods: 
Bicycle safety lights;
1. 
Computer mice; Computer mouse in the nature of a trackpad;
2. 
Wireless computer mice;
3. 
Electronic timers;
4. 
Electronic weighing scales for kitchen use;
5. 
Navigation apparatus for vehicles in the nature of on-board computers;
6. 
Remote controls for radios, televisions, stereos;
7. 
Smartwatch straps;
8. 
Wireless headsets for smartphones.   
9. 
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §904.02(c)(i), (c)(iii).
 
If in response to the above requirement, applicant provides use of the mark on each of the 9 groups of 
enumerated goods, applicant must also provide documentation that shows payment or other 
consideration made for the 9 groups of enumerated goods, redacting personal or private information of 
buyers as necessary. If applicant is unable to provide specimens to support use of these separate groups 
of items, applicant must delete these entries, or amend the filing basis for those goods that were not in 
proper use as of the application filing date to an intent to use basis under Section 1(b).   Amending toSection 1(b) will later necessitate additional fees and filing requirements such as providing a specimen 
for these goods at a subsequent date.   
 
For more information about the different legal requirements for each basis, for submitting more than 
one basis, and for instructions on how to satisfy these requirements online using the Trademark 
Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, please go to the Basis webpage.   
  
Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an independent ground for refusing 
registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 (TTAB 2021) (citing In re 
Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 
1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814). Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this 
requirement for information. See In re Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) 
(citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814.    
 
 
SIGNATURE/SUBMISSION CONSTITUTES CERTIFICATION UNDER 37 C.F.R. §11.18(B) 
(Advisory) 
Any party who signs or otherwise presents a document to the USPTO is subject to 37 C.F.R. §11.18(b). 
Lewis Silkin LLP v. Firebrand LLC, 129 USPQ2d 1015, 1020 n.8 (TTAB 2018). Thus, an attorney, 
applicant, or other party who signs or submits a document in connection with a trademark application is 
certifying that:
 
(1)        All statements made in the document of the party’s own knowledge are true, 
all statements made on information and belief are believed to be true, and all statements 
made are made with the knowledge that, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the 
USPTO, any party who knowingly and willfully makes any false, fictitious, or fraudulent 
statements or representations, is subject to the penalties under 18 U.S.C. §1001, including 
fines and imprisonment;

inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, the document is not being presented for any 
improper purpose;

support or are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further 
investigation or discovery; and
 
(4)        All denials of factual contentions in the document are warranted on the 
evidence or are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §11.18(b); TMEP §611.01(a).
 
Violating 37 C.F.R. §11.18(b) may jeopardize the validity of an application and any resulting 
registration, and may lead the USPTO to impose sanctions and/or take other appropriate actions under 
37 C.F.R. §11.18(c), which may include the following: rejecting the relevant document or according it 
less probative value; referring the attorney’s conduct to the USPTO’s Office of Enrollment and 
Discipline for possible disciplinary action; excluding the attorney or other party from practicing before, 
or otherwise submitting documents to, the USPTO; and requiring a party to be represented by a 
qualified attorney in any current or future trademark matters before the USPTO.PARTIAL ABANDONMENT (Advisory)

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119515
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the

to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
