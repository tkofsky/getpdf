Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicantmust respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),

SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
REFUSAL - MARK IS PRIMARILY GEOGRAPHICALLY DESCRIPTIVE
•
SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTER ADVISORY
•
MARK DESCRIPTION 
•
 
SEARCH OF OFFICE RECORDS - NO CONFLICTING MARKS FOUND 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Registration is refused, however, for the following reason(s):
 
REFUSAL - MARK IS PRIMARILY GEOGRAPHICALLY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is primarily geographically descriptive of the 
origin of applicant’s goods and/or services. Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); see 
TMEP §§1210, 1210.01(a).
A mark is primarily geographically descriptive when the following is demonstrated:
 
(1)        The primary significance of the mark to the purchasing public is a generally 
known location;
 
(2)        The goods or services originate in the place identified in the mark; and
 
(3)        The purchasing public would be likely to believe that the goods or services 
originate in the geographic place identified in the mark; that is, to make a goods-place or 
services-place association.
 
See Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *5 (TTAB 2020) (citing 
In re Nantucket, Inc., 677 F.2d 95, 96-97, 213 USPQ 889, 891 (C.C.P.A. 1982)); see also In re 
Newbridge Cutlery Co., 776 F.3d 854, 860-61, 113 USPQ2d 1445, 1448-49 (Fed. Cir. 2015); In re 
Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1452 (Fed. 
Cir. 1987); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 (TTAB 2001)); TMEP §1210.01(a).
 
In this case, the applied-for mark is INDIAFLIX.  As the attached dictionary evidence shows, 
"India" identifies "country of southern Asia covering most of the Indian subcontinent." Thus, the 
primary significance of the mark is that of a generally-known location.  In addition, "flick," the 
phonetic equivalent of "flix" in the mark, an informal word for "movie."  Further, as the attached 
internet evidence shows, movies from India are well-known, as evidenced by the attached article from 
SW discussing the top 10 Indian films known throughout the world. Therefore, the mark INDIAFLIX 
is descriptive of the services in that they relate to streaming of movies, or flicks, from India. 
 
Mmoreover the addition of the rectangle design to the mark does not alter its geographic significance 
because most common geometric shapes, such as circles, ovals, triangles, diamonds, or stars, whenused as a background for word or letter marks are not considered inherently distinctive. See In re 
Benetton Grp. S.p.A., 48 USPQ2d 1214, 1216 (TTAB 1998). As the Board explained,
 
The rationale . . . is that designs of this character have been so commonly employed as 
background devices for word marks that composite marks of this type create but a single 
commercial impression with the result that purchasers would normally utilize the word portions 
of the marks to identify and distinguish the goods sold thereunder . . . .
 
In re Wendy’s Int’l, Inc., 227 USPQ 884, 885 (TTAB 1985) (quoting Permatex Co. v. Cal. Tube Prods., 
Inc., 175 USPQ 764, 766 (TTAB 1972)).
 
Thus, registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(e)2) of the Trademark Act.  Although registration 
has been refused, applicant may present arguments in support of registration.   
 
SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTER ADVISORY
 
Although an amendment to the Supplemental Register would be an appropriate response to this 
refusal in an application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) or 44, such a response is not appropriate 
in the present case. The instant application was filed under Section 1(b) and is not eligible for 
registration on the Supplemental Register until an acceptable amendment to allege use meeting the 
requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been timely filed. 37 C.F.R. §2.47(d); TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03.
 
If applicant files an acceptable allegation of use and also amends to the Supplemental Register, the 
application effective filing date will be the date applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 
37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for an amendment to allege use. TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b). 
In addition, the undersigned trademark examining attorney will conduct a new search of the USPTO 
records for conflicting marks based on the later application filing date. TMEP §§206.01, 1102.03.
 
Applicant may file an Amendment to Allege Use through the following link:  
 
https://teas.uspto.gov/wna/aou/ 
 
MARK DESCRIPTION 
 
The mark description must amended to change "square" to "rectangle."  In addition, applicant must 
indicate where the color white appears in the mark. The following is suggested: 
 
The mark consists of the wording "INDIAFLIX" in white, wherein the space below the dot in the letter 
"I" in "FLIX" is a black square.  All of the foregoing is within a red rectangle.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 2.72; TMEP §§808 et seq.

•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
