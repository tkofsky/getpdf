SECTION 2(e)(2) REFUSAL – PRIMARILY GEOGRAPHICALLY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark is primarily geographically descriptive of the 
origin of applicant’s services. Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); see TMEP 
§§1210, 1210.01(a). 
 
A mark is primarily geographically descriptive when the following is demonstrated:
 
(1)        The primary significance of the mark to the purchasing public is a generally known 
location;
 
(2)        The services originate in the place identified in the mark; and
 
(3)        The purchasing public would be likely to believe that the services originate in the 
geographic place identified in the mark; that is, to make a services-place association.
 
See Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at *5 (TTAB 2020) (citing 
In re Nantucket, Inc., 677 F.2d 95, 96-97, 213 USPQ 889, 891 (C.C.P.A. 1982)); see also In re 
Newbridge Cutlery Co., 776 F.3d 854, 860-61, 113 USPQ2d 1445, 1448-49 (Fed. Cir. 2015); In re 
Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1452 (Fed. 
Cir. 1987); In re JT Tobacconists, 59 USPQ2d 1080, 1081 (TTAB 2001)); TMEP §1210.01(a).
 
In the present case, all three of the above criteria are met: 
 
SANTA 
MONICA 
is 
a 
generally 
known 
location.  See specifically, 
attached 
from Wikipedia ("Santa Monica...is a beachfront city in western Los Angeles County, California, 
United States...The 2020 U.S. Census population of Santa Monica was 93,076").
•
 
For services to originate in a geographic place, the record must show that they are rendered at 
least in part in the geographic place. See In re Chalk’s Int’l Airline Inc., 21 USPQ2d 1637 
(TTAB 1991) (holding PARADISE ISLAND AIRLINES primarily geographically descriptive of 
air transportation services of passengers and/or goods that are performed at least in part on 
Paradise Island); In re Cal. Pizza Kitchen Inc., 10 USPQ2d 1704 (TTAB 1988) (holding 
CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN primarily geographically descriptive of restaurant services 
rendered in California and outside the state as well); In re Opryland USA Inc., 1 USPQ2d 1409 
(TTAB 1986) (holding THE NASHVILLE NETWORK primarily geographically descriptive of 
•television production and distribution services provided in Nashville); TMEP §1210.03.  In the 
present case, applicant states that the services originate in SANTA MONICA.  See specifically, 
"Significance of Mark" statement in application ("Santa Monica Brake appearing in the mark 
means or signifies or is a term of art for auto repair done in Santa Monica in the relevant trade or 
industry or as used in connection with the goods/services listed in the application.") and 
"Miscellaneous Statement" in the application ("Santa Monica Brake is an auto repair shop 
located in Santa Monica, California, that performs auto repair, especially on brake systems").
 
A services-place association may be presumed where (1) the location in the mark is generally 
known to the purchasing public, (2) the term’s geographical significance is its primary 
significance, and (3) the services do, in fact, originate from the named location in the mark. 
TMEP §1210.04; see, e.g., In re Cal. Pizza Kitchen Inc., 10 USPQ2d 1704, 1705 (TTAB 1988) 
(finding a services-place association was presumed between applicant’s restaurant services and 
California because the services originated in California); In re Handler Fenton Ws., Inc., 214 
USPQ 848, 850 (TTAB 1982) (finding a goods-place association was presumed between 
applicant’s t-shirts and Denver because the goods had their geographical origin in Denver); see 
also In re Nantucket, Inc., 677 F.2d 95, 102, 213 USPQ 889, 895 (C.C.P.A. 1982) (Nies, J., 
concurring) (“[W]e must start with the concept that a geographic name of a place of business is a 
descriptive term when used on the goods of that business. There is a public goods/place 
association, in effect, presumed.” (internal footnote removed)).  In the present case, a services-
place association may be presumed since (1) SANTA MONICA is a generally known location, 
(2) the term's geographical significance is its primary significance and (3) the services do, in fact, 
originate in SANTA MONICA. 
•
 
Finally, the additional descriptive and disclaimed wording in the mark, namely, "BRAKE" does not 
obviate this refusal, as the addition of generic or highly descriptive wording to a geographic word or 
term does not diminish that geographic word or term’s primary geographic significance. TMEP 
§1210.02(c)(ii); see, e.g., Spiritline Cruises LLC v. Tour Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 48324, at 
*6-7 (TTAB 2020) (holding CHARLESTON HARBOR TOURS primarily geographically descriptive 
of various travel tour and cruise services because TOURS is generic for the services and 
CHARLESTON HARBOR is a well-known harbor in Charleston, South Carolina); In re Hollywood 
Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 1852, 1853-54 (TTAB 2014) (holding HOLLYWOOD LAWYERS 
ONLINE primarily geographically descriptive of attorney referrals, online business information, and an 
online business directory).
 
As such, for the reasons discussed above, applicant’s mark is refused registration on the Principal 
Register under Trademark Act Section 2(e)(2) for being primarily geographically descriptive. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to any other refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) set forth below.
 
ADVISORY: AMENDMENT TO SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTER SUGGESTED 
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register. Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816. Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant 
from submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal(s). TMEP §816.04.Although registration on the Supplemental Register does not afford all the benefits of registration on 
the Principal Register, it does provide the following advantages to the registrant:
 
(1)       Use of the registration symbol ® with the registered mark in connection with the 
designated goods and/or services, which provides public notice of the registration and potentially deters 
third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(2)       Inclusion of the registered mark in the USPTO’s database of registered and pending 
marks, which will (a) make it easier for third parties to find it in trademark search reports, (b) provide 
public notice of the registration, and thus (c) potentially deter third parties from using confusingly 
similar marks.
 
(3)       Use of the registration by a USPTO trademark examining attorney as a bar to registering 
confusingly similar marks in applications filed by third parties.
 
(4)       Use of the registration as a basis to bring suit for trademark infringement in federal court, 
which, although more costly than state court, means judges with more trademark experience, often 
faster adjudications, and the opportunity to seek an injunction, actual damages, and attorneys’ fees and 
costs.
 
(5)       Use of the registration as a filing basis for a trademark application for registration in 
certain foreign countries, in accordance with international treaties.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(d), 1091, 1094; J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair 
Competition §§19:33, 19:37 (rev. 4th ed. Supp. 2017).
 
Applicant should note the following additional ground for refusal.
 
SPECIMEN REFUSAL - DRAWING OR RENDERING OF MARK DOES NOT SHOW USE IN 
COMMERCE 
 
Specimen is merely a drawing or depiction of the mark. Registration is also refused because the 
specimen is merely a photocopy of the drawing or a depiction of the applied-for mark and does not 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the services in International Class 037. 
Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (c); In 
re Chica, 84 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (TTAB 2007); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An 
application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for 
mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of services identified in the application. 
15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual use 
in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application and (b) shows the mark in actual use 
in commerce for the services identified in the application. A “verified substitute specimen” is a 
specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a 
declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) 
specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application.” The 
substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, including 
a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
CLARIFICATION OF ENTITY INFORMATION REQUIRED 
 
The name of an individual person appears in the section of the application intended for the trademark 
owner’s name; however, the legal entity is set forth as a limited liability company. Applicant must 
clarify this inconsistency. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), (a)(3)(i)-(ii), 2.61(b); TMEP §803.02(a).
 
If applicant is an individual, applicant should simply request that the legal entity be amended to 
“individual” and must indicate his/her country of citizenship for the record. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(i); 
TMEP §803.03(a). Alternatively, if applicant is a limited liability company, applicant must provide the 
correct name of the limited liability company and the U.S. state or foreign country of incorporation or 
organization. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §803.03(h).
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration may be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).
 
ADVISORY: APPLICANT MAY WISH TO SEEK TRADEMARK COUNSEL 
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for 
more information.
 
RESPONSE GUIDELINESFor this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal and/or requirement in this 
Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and evidence against the refusal, 
and may have other response options if specified above. For a requirement, applicant should set forth 
the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office Actions” and the informational video 
“Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on responding.

number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
