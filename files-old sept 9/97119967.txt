Refusal - Likelihood of Confusion 
•
 
 
Section 2(d) Refusal - Likelihood of Confusion
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 4984069. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
In this case, the applicant's applied-for mark NEXXUS BOWHUNTING is similar in sound, 
appearance, and commercial impression to the mark NEXUS in the cited registration.  Although marks 
are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in creating 
a commercial impression. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. 
Cir. 2012); In re Nat’l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or generic for a party’s goods and/or 
services is typically less significant or less dominant when comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 
903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 
F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).
 
In this case, it is the wording NEXXUS in applicant's mark that is more significant or dominant in 
creating a commercial impression because the wording BOWHUNTING is less significant as 
disclaimed matter.  See discussion below regarding the required disclaimer of the wording"bowhunting."  Further, there is no correct pronunciation of a mark; thus, consumers may pronounce a 
mark differently than intended by the mark owner. See In re Viterra, Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1367, 101 
USPQ2d 1905, 1912 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Interlego AG v. Abrams/Gentile Entm’t, Inc., 63 USPQ2d 
1862, 1863 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(iv). In the present case, the wording NEXXUS in 
applicant's mark and NEXUS in the cited mark could clearly be pronounced the same. Such similarity 
in sound alone may be sufficient to support a finding that the compared marks are confusingly similar. 
In re 1st USA Realty Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007) (citing Krim-Ko Corp. v. 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 390 F.2d 728, 732, 156 USPQ 523, 526 (C.C.P.A. 1968)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(iv).
 
Further, the slight difference in the spelling of these marks is not sufficient to distinguish these marks 
from consumer confusion.  Therefore, when the marks in this case are considered in their entireties, it is 
concluded that the applicant's mark and cited mark both share the confusingly similar appearing, 
identical sounding, and dominant wording NEXXUS and NEXUS.  
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the registration uses broad wording to describe "archery equipment, namely, arrows," 
which presumably encompasses all goods of the type described, including applicant’s more narrow 
"archery equipment, namely, arrow shafts."  See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 
1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 
USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 
F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 
USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 
1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are related.
 
Further, the stated identifications of goods language in both the application and cited registration 
clearly show that both are providing archery equipment specifically pertaining to arrows.  This 
evidence alone supports the conclusion that the applicant's goods and registrant's goods are related for 
the purposes of the likelihood of confusion analysis.
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or 
services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer. See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the 
registrant. TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Identification of Goods - Clarification Required - Class 028
 
The wording “arrow components” in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified 
because it is ambiguous and unclear. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must 
amend this wording to specify the common commercial or generic name of the goods. See TMEP 
§1402.01. If the goods have no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the 
product, its main purpose, and its intended uses. See id.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:
 
"Archery equipment, namely, arrow shafts; [insert type of "arrow components," e.g., archery 
equipment in the nature of arrow components, namely, archery arrow points], in International Class 
028."
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
Disclaimer
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “BOWHUNTING” because it is merely descriptive of a 
characteristic or use of applicant’s goods.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. 
Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP 
§§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from Oxford Dictionary shows that this wording means The practice of hunting 
animals with a bow rather than a gun.  Consumers encountering applicant's mark will immediately 
understand that the goods are used in and/or are marketed for bowhunting.  Thus, this wording must be 
disclaimed.  
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “BOWHUNTING” apart from the mark as 
shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
