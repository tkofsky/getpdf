SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Recitation of services and related multiple class application requirements
•
Fee for losing Teas Plus status
•
 
 
Recitation of services
The identification of services is indefinite and overly broad and must be clarified as detailed in brackets 
below.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must amend the identification to specify 
the common commercial or generic name of the services. See TMEP §1402.01. If the services have no 
common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe or explain the nature of the services 
using clear and succinct language. See id.
 
Note that applicant's recitation of services is very awkwardly worded and it is not clear what actual 
services applicant is providing.    It is not clear what the development of education refers to-is applicant 
developing some sort of educational materials or is applicant merely providing the training etc which 
furthers users education?   Further, it is not clear what "online services and other educational 
technologies" references.  
 
Applicant may adopt the following wording, if accurate:
 
[clarify the nature of the services and classify accordingly, as discussed above, eg: 
 
Educational services, namely, providing training, seminars and classes in the field of communication 
technologies, in class 41  (The field of "technology" is also unclear and needs to be further clarified for 
this entry). 
 
Education services, namely, developing curriculum for educators to use in training, seminars 
and classes in the field of technology, in class 41 
 
Developing educational computer software for use in online training, seminars and classes in the field 
of technology, in class 42] 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Additional class requirements
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark ActSection 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that 
are classified in at least 2 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 
class(es).  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the 
submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already 
paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
Fee for Losing Teas Plus status 
Processing fee required. Applicant must submit an additional processing fee of $100 per class because 
the application as filed did not meet the TEAS Plus application filing requirements. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.22(a)(7), (c); TMEP §§819.01(g), 819.03. Specifically, the application did not include only 
identifications of goods and/or services from the U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services 
Manual. TMEP §819.01(g); see 37 C.F.R §2.22(a)(7).
 
In this case, the application identified one or more goods and/or services from the ID Manual that used 
a fill-in-the-blank format.  However, applicant inserted wording in the identification that is clearly 
inappropriate or unrelated to the selected goods and/or services.  By inserting inappropriate wording, 
applicant has, in effect, failed to submit an identification from the ID Manual and thus did not satisfy 
this application filing requirement.  See 37 C.F.R §2.22(a)(7); TMEP §819.01(g). 
 
The additional processing fee is required regardless of whether applicant satisfies this requirement by 
deleting the unacceptable wording in the identification. TMEP §819.01(g).
 
Accordingly, the application will no longer be treated as TEAS Plus; it is now considered a TEAS 
Standard application.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO

•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
