NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 22, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has  determined the following.  15 U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Potential Refusal-Likelihood of Confusion
•
Unsigned Application
•
Identification
•
Section 44- Option to Delete Section 1(b) Basis 
•
 
 
POTENTIAL REFUSAL-LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 97032604 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
Common Ownership Information
If the mark(s) in the potentially conflicting prior-filed application(s) has been assigned to applicant, 
applicant may provide evidence of ownership of the mark(s) to avoid a possible refusal under 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) based on a likelihood of confusion. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP 
§812.01.
 
Applicant may provide evidence of ownership of the mark(s) by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Record the assignment with the USPTO’s Assignment Recordation Branch 
(ownership transfer documents such as assignments can be filed online at 
http://etas.uspto.gov) and promptly notify the trademark examining attorney that the 
assignment has been duly recorded;
 
(2)        Submit copies of documents evidencing the chain of title; or
 
(3)        Submit the following statement, verified with an affidavit or signed 
declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “Applicant is the owner of Application Serial No(s). 
97032604.” To provide this statement using the Trademark Electronic Application System 
(TEAS), use the “Response to Office Action” form; answer “yes” to wizard questions #3 
and #9; then, continuing on to the next portion of the form, in the “Additional 
Statement(s)” section, check the box for “Miscellaneous Statement” and write in the free 
form text field for the “Miscellaneous Statement” that “Applicant is the owner ofApplication Serial No(s). 97032604,” inserting the relevant application serial number(s); 
and follow the instructions within the form for signing.  The form must be signed twice; a 
signature is required both in the “Declaration Signature” section and in the “Response 
Signature” section.
 
TMEP §812.01; see 15 U.S.C. §1060; 37 C.F.R. §§2.193(e)(1), 3.25, 3.73(a)-(b); TMEP §502.02(a).
 
Recording a document with the Assignment Recordation Branch does not constitute a response to an 
Office action. TMEP §503.01(d).
 
Applicant must respond to the requirement(s) set forth below. 
 
UNSIGNED APPLICATION
The application was unsigned, resulting in the application not being properly verified. See TMEP §804. 
Applicant must properly sign and therefore verify the application in an affidavit or signed declaration 
under 37 C.F.R. §2.20. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.2(n), 2.33(a)-(c), 2.34(a)(1)(i), (a)(2), (a)(3)(i), (a)(4)(ii); 
TMEP §804.02.
 
The following statements must be verified: That applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in 
commerce and had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the application filing date; 
that applicant believes applicant is entitled to use the mark in commerce on or in connection with the 
goods or services specified in the application; that applicant believes applicant is the owner of the 
mark; that the mark is in use in commerce and was in use in commerce as of the application filing date; 
that to the best of the signatory’s knowledge and belief, no other persons, except, if applicable, 
concurrent users, have the right to use the mark in commerce, either in the identical form or in such 
near resemblance as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods/services of such other 
persons, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive; that the specimen shows the mark as used on or 
in connection with the goods or services as of the application filing date; and that the facts set forth in 
the application are true. 37 C.F.R. §§2.33(b), (c), 2.34(a)(1)(i), (a)(2), (a)(3)(i), (a)(4)(ii), 2.59(a).
 
For more information about the verified statement and instructions on providing one using the online 
Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see the Verified statement webpage.
 
IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENT
The identification of "retail store services and online retail store services of .... tablets" is indefinite and 
must be clarified because to describe the services by common commercial name and to describe the 
featured goods by common commercial name. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. 
 
Applicant may adopt the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 35: Retail store services and online retail store services featuring eyewear, accessories for 
telephones and tablet computers, jewellery, horological instruments, bags and small leatherware, 
namely, wallets, purses, card wallets, money holders, briefcases, purses, key cases, luggage tags, 
clothing, footwear, headwear, hosiery, connected clothing, smart clothing, connected footwear, smart 
footwear; arranging, conducting and promoting special events for commercial and advertising 
purposes; Advertising and organization of fashion shows for promotional purposes; Shop window 
dressing; Sample distributionNote that bolding, italics, and the like are used only to highlight suggested changes to the original 
language. 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
 
SECTION 44- OPTION TO DELETE SECTION 1(B) BASIS
The application specifies both an intent to use basis under Trademark Act Section 1(b) and reliance on 
a foreign registration(s) under Section 44(e). See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 1126(e); 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2)-
(3). However, the foreign registration alone may serve as a basis for obtaining a U.S. registration. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3); TMEP §806.01(d). If applicant wants to rely solely on the foreign registration 
under Section 44(e) as the basis, applicant can request deletion of the Section 1(b) basis. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.35(b)(1); TMEP §806.04.
 
Unless applicant indicates otherwise, the USPTO will presume that applicant is relying on both 
Sections 1(b) and 44(e). Thus, although the mark may be approved for publication, it will not register 
until an acceptable allegation of use has been filed for the goods and/or services based on Section 1(b).
 
RESPONSE GUIDELINES
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118872
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.

(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
