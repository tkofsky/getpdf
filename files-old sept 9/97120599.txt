The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicantmust respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive
•
Classification and Identification of Services
•
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature or characteristic of 
applicant’s services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 
1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
Two major reasons for not protecting descriptive marks are (1) to prevent the owner of a descriptive 
mark from inhibiting competition in the marketplace and (2) to avoid the possibility of costly 
infringement suits brought by the trademark or service mark owner. In re Abcor Dev. Corp., 588 F.2d 
811, 813, 200 USPQ 215, 217 (C.C.P.A. 1978); TMEP §1209. Businesses and competitors should be 
free to use descriptive language when describing their own goods and/or services to the public in 
advertising and marketing materials. See In re Styleclick.com Inc., 58 USPQ2d 1523, 1527 (TTAB 
2001).
 
Here, applicant has applied to register the mark INSTANT LEADERBOARD PAYOUT for use in 
connection with “Payment exchange services of micro- and nano-transactions of cryptocurrency 
utilizing blockchain technology” in Class 36, and "Providing online gaming platform for competitive 
video games" in Class 41.
 
Please see the attached dictionary definitions showing that “INSTANT” means "Occurring at once; 
immediate", "LEADERBOARD" means "A board that displays the leaders in a competition", and 
"PAYOUT" means "The act or an instance of paying out". 
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods and/or services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not 
registrable. In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re 
Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such ashypodermic, aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 
(TTAB 2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner 
that is an integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services is the combined mark 
registrable. See In re Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial 
Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 
364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services. 
 
In the context of the services, the combined wording of "INSTANT LEADERBOARD PAYOUT" 
immediately conveys that the services are provide immediate payment to users based on their position 
on a leaderboard. Specifically, the attached Internet evidence from applicant's website shows that users 
of the applied-for services are paid based on their position on video game leaderboards. 
 
In view of the above, the applied-for mark is merely descriptive of a feature and characteristic of the 
applicant’s services, and therefore, registration is refused under Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. Applicant must address the following 
requirement.
 
CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES
 
The identification of services in Classes 36 and 42 is indefinite and/or misclassified and must be 
clarified or reclassified to ensure proper analysis.
 
In Class 36, the wording “Providing online gaming platform for competitive video games” in the 
identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified to further specify the nature of the services, 
as set forth below. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. 
Additionally, this wording is misclassified, as such software is classified in Class 42. 
 
In Class 41, the wording “Payment exchange services of micro- and nano-transactions of 
cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain technology” in the identification of services is indefinite and must 
be clarified to further specify the nature of the services, as set forth below. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.0
41
 
Applicant may adopt the following suggestions, if accurate:
 
036: Payment exchange services in the nature of cryptocurrency exchange services, namely, 
processing micro- and nano-transactions of cryptocurrency utilizing blockchain technology
 
042: Providing temporary use of online non-downloadable software in the nature of an online 
gaming platform for playing competitive video gamesApplicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand the 
services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).

to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
