Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.Summary of Issues 
 
Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
•
Identification of Goods – Amendment Required
•
Multiple Class Application Requirements - Section 1(b) 
•
 
Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Identification of Goods – Amendment Required 
 
An applicant should not use its own registered or unregistered mark in an identification of goods and/or 
services. TMEP §1402.09. Identifications of goods and/or services should generally be comprised of 
generic everyday wording for the goods and/or services, and exclude proprietary or potentially-
proprietary wording, such as a registered term. See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.09. The misspelling or 
phonetic equivalent of a registered mark should similarly be excluded, unless it is the common name of 
the goods and/or services. TMEP §1402.09.
 
Here, the wording "Gutter Slut is a one man band . . ." appearing in the identification of goods for 
International Class 025 not only uses applicant's unregistered mark, the wording "is a one man band" 
also does not identify services. See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.09. As such, this wording should be 
removed from the identification. 
 
The Trademark Act requires that a trademark or service mark application must include a “specification 
of … the goods [or services]” in connection with which the mark is being used or will be used. 15 
U.S.C. §1051(a)(2) (emphasis added), (b)(2) (emphasis added); see 15 U.S.C. §1053. Specifically, a 
complete application must include a “list of the particular goods or services on or in connection with 
which the applicant uses or intends to use the mark.” 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6) (emphasis added). This 
requirement for a specification of the particular goods and/or services applies to applications filed 
under all statutory bases. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(a)(2), 1051(b)(2), 1053, 1126(d)-(e), 1141f; 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.01(b)-(c).
 
Along those lines, the remaining wording, "that will provide music via streaming and will sell band 
merchandise online” in the identification of goods in International Class 025 must be clarified because 
it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. The wording "will 
provide music via streaming" is misclassified, as this wording represents a service, not goods properly 
classified in International Class 025. Moreover, this wording does not identify particular services and 
could encompass the telecommunications services of "Streaming of audio material on the Internet" in 
International Class 038 or "Entertainment services, namely, live performances by a musical band 
streamed over the Internet" in International Class 041. If accurate, applicant may respond by (1) adding 
International Class 041 to the application and reclassifying these services in the proper international 
class, (2) deleting “that will provide music via streaming” from the application, or (3) deleting the 
remainder of the items in the identification and reclassifying the specified services in the proper 
international class. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.86(a), 6.1; TMEP §§1403.02 et seq. If applicant adds one or 
more international classes to the application, applicant must comply with the multiple-class 
requirements specified in this Office action.The wording “and will sell band merchandise online” in the identification of goods for International 
Class 025 is indefinite and must be clarified because this wording does not point to particular goods 
encompassed by "band merchandise."  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must 
amend this wording to specify the common commercial or generic name of the goods. See TMEP 
§1402.01. If the goods have no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the 
product, its main purpose, and its intended uses. See id. Further, this wording could identify goods 
and services in more than one international class. For example, this wording could encompass 
"Downloadable audio recordings featuring music," "Pre-recorded record albums featuring music," "Pre-
recorded CDs featuring music," and "Pre-recorded DVDs featuring music," all  in International Class 
009, "Stickers" and "Decals" in International Class 016, various clothing items in International Class 
025, "Ornamental cloth patches" in International Class 026, and "On-line retail store services featuring 
downloadable pre-recorded music", meaning the downloadable pre-recorded music of others, in 
International Class 035. Suggested amendments have been provided below as examples for applicant to 
incorporate, if accurate. As indicated above, if applicant adds one or more international classes to the 
application, applicant must comply with the multiple-class requirements specified in this Office action.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate (changes in bold and underlined): 
 
International Class 009: Downloadable audio recordings featuring music; Pre-recorded 
record albums featuring music; Pre-recorded CDs featuring music; Pre-recorded DVDs 
featuring music
•
 
International Class 016: Stickers; Decals 
•
 
International Class 025: Clothing, namely, {specify types of clothing, e.g., hats, beanies, t-
shirts, sweatshirts} 
•
 
International Class 026: Ornamental cloth patches
•
 
International 
Class 041: Entertainment 
services, 
namely, 
live 
performances 
by 
a 
musical band streamed over the Internet 
•
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and services, but not to broaden or 
expand the goods and services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).  
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.  
 
Multiple Class Application Requirements - Section 1(b) 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number inconsecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already 
paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). The application identifies goods and/or 
services that are classified in at least five (5) classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) 
sufficient for only one (1) class(es). Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the 
classes not covered by the submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of 
classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).

requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the

Advisory regarding Hiring a Trademark Attorney
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for 
more information.
