Trademark Act Section 2(d) Refusal - Likelihood of Confusion
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 4453514. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq.  Please see the enclosed registration at Attachment 1.  Registrant's mark is SAVE-
FACE in standard characters for "Cosmetic creams for skin care; Cosmetic preparations against 
sunburn; Cosmetic preparations for protecting the skin from the sun's rays; Cosmetic preparations for 
skin care; Cosmetic sunscreen preparations; Skin conditioning creams for cosmetic purposes." 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-
by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 
1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 
F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those 
factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in 
every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) 
(quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods . See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 
1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 
USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the 
cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods and differences in the 
marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of 
terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See 
Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), 
aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 
1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH 
confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM 
and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
In the present case, the proposed mark is SAVE FACE in stylized form and the registered mark is 
SAVE-FACE in standard characters.  The marks are identical in sound and connotation and virtually 
identical in appearance because they consist of the same words in the same order.  The hyphen between 
the words in the registered mark is a visually minor element that does not obviate the overall similarity 
of the parties' marks, which both connote the phrase "save face."
 
The stylization in the proposed mark does not obviate the similarity of the marks because the registered 
mark is in standard characters and could be displayed in a similar font and style.  A mark in typed or 
standard characters may be displayed in any lettering style; the rights reside in the wording or other 
literal element and not in any particular display or rendition. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 
1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 
USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. §2.52(a); TMEP §1207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a mark 
presented in stylized characters and/or with a design element generally will not avoid likelihood of 
confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters because the word portion could be presented in 
the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; 
Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that “the 
argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable where one party asserts rights in no 
particular display”).
 
For these reasons, the parties' marks convey a highly similar overall commercial impression.
 
Relatedness of the GoodsThe goods are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the descriptions of the goods stated in the application 
and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 
1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).
 
Applicant's goods consist of "Beauty products. Touch-Up Kit and eye make-up remover swabs." 
 
Registrant's goods consist of "Cosmetic creams for skin care; Cosmetic preparations against sunburn; 
Cosmetic preparations for protecting the skin from the sun's rays; Cosmetic preparations for skin care; 
Cosmetic sunscreen preparations; Skin conditioning creams for cosmetic purposes."
 
In this case, the application uses broad wording to describe "beauty products," which presumably 
encompasses all goods of the type described, including registrant’s more narrowly identified goods 
comprising "Cosmetic creams for skin care; Cosmetic preparations against sunburn; Cosmetic 
preparations for protecting the skin from the sun's rays; Cosmetic preparations for skin care; Cosmetic 
sunscreen preparations; Skin conditioning creams for cosmetic purposes." See, e.g., In re Solid State 
Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 
USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally identical in 
part. See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo 
Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 
1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. 
Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods of the parties have no restrictions as to channels of trade or classes of 
purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of purchasers.” 
In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting Hewlett-
Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir. 2002)). 
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are related.
 
However, the compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods] 
emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Applicant's goods comprising a "touch up kit" and "eye makeup remover swabs" are closely related to 
goods in the cited registration, such as "Cosmetic preparations for skin care," because these types of 
goods are personal care products that commonly originate from a single source under the same 
mark. Attachment 3, consisting of screenshots from the websites of Rare Beauty, Sephora and Almay, 
establishes that the same entity commonly produces the relevant goods and markets the goods under the 
same mark, and that the relevant goods are sold through the same trade channels and used by the sameclasses of consumers in the same fields of use.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are considered 
related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 
1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 
2009). 
 
Summary 
 
Because applicant's mark is nearly identical to the registered mark, and because applicant's goods are 
legally identical and/or closely related to goods in the cited registration, there is a likelihood of 
confusion as to the source of the goods.
 
The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods and/or 
services, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a 
newcomer. See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
Therefore, any doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the 
registrant. TMEP §1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 
1265, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464-
65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
 
ADVISORY - Application Not Entitled to Register – One Pending Application with Earlier Filing 
Date 
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 97008228 precedes applicant’s filing date.  
Please see the referenced application at Attachment 2.  If the mark in the referenced application 
registers, applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a 
likelihood of confusion between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP 
§§1208 et seq.  Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this 
application may be suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
Ownership of Prior-Filed Application 
 
It is noted that the applicant is SAVE FACE BEAUTY, a limited liability company of California, while 
the owner of the prior-filed application is Save Face Beauty LLC, a limited liability company of 
Florida.  The parties have the same physical address, and thus it appears that there may be a 
relationship between the parties.
 
If the mark in the potentially conflicting prior-filed application has been assigned to applicant, 
applicant may provide evidence of ownership of the mark to avoid a possible refusal under Trademark 
Act Section 2(d) based on a likelihood of confusion. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §812.01.Applicant may provide evidence of ownership of the mark by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Record the assignment with the USPTO’s Assignment Recordation Branch 
(ownership transfer documents such as assignments can be filed online at 
http://etas.uspto.gov) and promptly notify the trademark examining attorney that the 
assignment has been duly recorded;
 
(2)        Submit copies of documents evidencing the chain of title; or
 
(3)        Submit the following statement, verified with an affidavit or signed 
declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “Applicant is the owner of Application Serial No. 
97008228.” To provide this statement using the Trademark Electronic Application System 
(TEAS), use the “Response to Office Action” form; answer “yes” to wizard questions #3 
and #9; then, continuing on to the next portion of the form, in the “Additional 
Statement(s)” section, check the box for “Miscellaneous Statement” and write in the free 
form text field for the “Miscellaneous Statement” that  “Applicant is the owner of 
Application Serial No(s). 97008228,” inserting the relevant application serial number(s); 
and follow the instructions within the form for signing.  The form must be signed twice; a 
signature is required both in the “Declaration Signature” section and in the “Response 
Signature” section.
 
TMEP §812.01; see 15 U.S.C. §1060; 37 C.F.R. §§2.193(e)(1), 3.25, 3.73(a)-(b); TMEP §502.02(a).
 
Recording a document with the Assignment Recordation Branch does not constitute a response to an 
Office action. TMEP §503.01(d).
 
 
Requirement to Clarify the Identification of Goods 
 
The wording “beauty products” in the identification of goods must be clarified because it is indefinite, 
too broad and could include goods in more than one international class.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.  For example, this wording could encompass "cosmetic skin care 
preparations" in International Class 3, "tweezers" in International Class 8, and "cosmetic spatulas" in 
International Class 21.  Therefore, applicant must specify the particular types of the goods using the 
common commercial or generic names for the goods, and classify the goods in the proper 
international class(es).  
 
The identification for “kits” in International Class 3 is indefinite and must be clarified. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1401.05(a), 1402.01, 1402.03. Kits generally consist of a group of component 
goods that (1) share a common theme, or (2) are used to make a particular product. See TMEP 
§1401.05(a). Applicant must amend the identification to list the components of the kits, using the 
guidelines below. See id.
 
For kits consisting of a group of components that share a common theme, the identification should 
specify the theme followed by the wording “comprising” or “comprised of” and a list of the 
components that make up the kit, with all of the components in the predominant class listed first. See 
id. Generally, a kit is classified in the same international class as the majority of the components in the 
kit. See id. For example, “nail care kits comprised of nail polish, nail polish remover, false nails, nail 
files, and printed instruction manuals” are in International Class 3, the class of the kits’ primarycomponents which are listed first in the kits’ components (with “nail files” in International Class 8, and 
“printed instruction manuals” in International Class 16 listed after the International Class 3 
components).
 
If there are no components that are more dominant than another in a shared-theme kit, the first 
component listed after the wording “comprising” or “comprised of” will determine the class of the kit. 
See id. For example, “tool kits comprising hand saws and power-driven saws” are in International Class 
8 (the class for “hand saws”), and “tool kits comprising power-driven saws and hand saws” are in 
International Class 7 (the class for “power-driven saws”).  
 
Kit components must include only goods, not services. TMEP §1401.05(a). For example, if computer 
software is listed as a component of a kit, the identification must indicate that the computer software is 
recorded or downloadable in International Class 9 and does not include the services of providing 
temporary use of online non-downloadable software in International Class 41 or 42. See id. An 
identification for a kit including software also must specify the function and any field of use of the 
software. See id.
 
Open-ended wording, such as “kits comprised of one or more of the following,” is unacceptable and 
should not be included in the identification. Id. Identifications must be clear and specific to enable 
proper classification of the goods and to facilitate determination of likelihood of confusion under 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d). See TMEP §1402.03(a).
 
For examples of other acceptable identifications for kits (e.g., sewing kits, face painting kits), please 
see the USPTO’s U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  
 
The wording “eye makeup remover swabs” in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be 
rewritten to clarify the nature of the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. 
 
Scope Advisory 
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
Suggested Amendments 
 
Applicant should note that any wording in bold or in bold italics below offers guidance and/or shows 
the changes being proposed for the identification of goods and/or services.  If there is wording in 
applicant’s version of the identification of goods and/or services that should be removed, it will be 
shown in bold with a line through it such as this: strikethrough.  Applicant should enter its 
amendments in standard font.  If applicant wishes to accept the suggested deletions, applicant must 
manually delete the struck through wording in any USPTO response form.  Copying and pasting thelanguage below will not result in deletion of the struck through wording, which will remain within the 
identification.
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification of goods if accurate:
 
International Class 3:  Beauty products, namely, {specify types in Class 3 using generic names, 
e.g., cosmetic preparations}; touch-up kits comprised of {specify components, listing primary 
Class 3 components first, e.g., eye makeup remover, cotton swabs for cosmetic use and cosmetic 
facial blotting papers}; cotton swabs impregnated with eye makeup remover swabs removing 
preparations 
 
International Class 8:  Beauty products, namely, {specify types in Class 8 using generic names, 
e.g., tweezers} 
 
International Class 21:  Beauty products, namely, {specify types in Class 21 using generic names, 
e.g., cosmetic spatulas}
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods in trademark applications, please see the 
USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See TMEP 
§1402.04. 
 
 
Multiple Class Requirements – Section 1(a) Basis 
 
Applicant must clarify the number of classes for which registration is sought. 
 
The application references goods based on use in commerce in more than one international class; 
therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class:
 
(1)        List the goods by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the 
fee already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods based on use in commerce that are classified in at least three classes; 
however, applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only one class. Applicant must either (a) 
submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) restrict the 
application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for International Class 3 only; and applicant needs a specimen for any 
additional classes. See more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated withthe goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c).

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120705
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
