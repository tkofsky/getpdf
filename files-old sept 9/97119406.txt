NONFINAL OFFICE ACTIONThe USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark(s) in 
U.S. Registration No(s). 5418948, 4232800, 3935722, 2726639, and 1892953.  Trademark Act Section 
2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the enclosed registration(s).
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that so resembles a registered mark 
that it is likely a potential consumer would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the source of the 
goods and/or services of the applicant and registrant.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  A determination of 
likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d) is made on a case-by case basis and the factors set forth in 
In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 177 USPQ 563 (C.C.P.A. 1973) aid in this 
determination.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d 1344, 1349, 98 USPQ2d 1253, 
1256 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citing On-Line Careline, Inc. v. Am. Online, Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1085, 56 
USPQ2d 1471, 1474 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).  Not all the du Pont factors, however, are necessarily relevant or 
of equal weight, and any one of the factors may control in a given case, depending upon the evidence of 
record.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d at 1355, 98 USPQ2d at 1260; In re 
Majestic Distilling Co., 315 F.3d 1311, 1315, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see In re E. I. 
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d at 1361-62, 177 USPQ at 567.
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant:  similarity of the marks, similarity and nature 
of the goods and/or services, and similarity of the trade channels of the goods and/or services.  See In re 
Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Dakin’s 
Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d 1593, 1595-96 (TTAB 1999); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
For the reasons discussed below, the examining attorney concludes that confusion as to the source of 
goods and/or services is likely between the applicant’s mark LEVITON, for Lampshades; Arc lamps; 
Electric lamps; Flashlights; Incandescent lamps; Lamp shades; Lamps; Light bulbs; Electric bulbs; 
LED lamps, and the registrants’ marks, LEVITON in standard characters and with design matter, for a 
wide variety of lights and lighting products.  
 
Comparison of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F. 3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marksconfusingly similar.”  In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014) (citing In re White Swan 
Ltd., 8 USPQ2d 1534, 1535 (TTAB 1988); In re 1st USA Realty Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
In this case, the marks all consist of, or include, the same distinctive and dominant term “LEVITON.” 
 
The applied-for mark appears in standard characters, and could be rendered in a stylized form similar or 
identical to that of the registered marks. A mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in 
any lettering style; the rights reside in the wording or other literal element and not in any particular 
display or rendition. See In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 
2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.52(a); TMEP §1207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a mark presented in stylized characters and/or with a design 
element generally will not avoid likelihood of confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters 
because the word portion could be presented in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 
671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 
939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that “the argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable 
where one party asserts rights in no particular display”).
 
Comparison of the Goods and/or Services
 
The goods and/or services of the parties need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood 
of confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 
1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 
2000) (“[E]ven if the goods in question are different from, and thus not related to, one another in kind, 
the same goods can be related in the mind of the consuming public as to the origin of the goods.”); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). 
 
The respective goods and/or services need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing [be] such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Additionally, a likelihood of confusion determination is based on the description of the goods and/or 
services stated in the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See 
In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, registrant's goods include "lamps" which are the same as, or encompass (i.e., are legally 
identical to), the applicant's "Arc lamps; Electric lamps; Arc lamps; Electric lamps; Lamps; LED 
lamps."  As such, the parties' goods overlap with each other and are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills 
Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. 
Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 
USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)). 
 
"Light bulbs" may emanate from the same commercial sources as the registrant's goods.  In fact, the 
registrant actually sells "leviton" branded light bulbs.  See attached evidence from bhphotovideo.com 
(accessed 8/25/2022).Similarly, lamp shades commonly share retail channels with the both parties' goods (e.g., lamps). See 
attached evidence from https://gaylordslampandshade.com/, https://www.lampsunlimitedmclean.com/, 
and https://www.shadesoflight.com/ (all accessed 8/24/2022). 
 
Additionally, the goods and/or services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of 
trade, or classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same 
class of purchasers.” In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)). Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
Thus, the goods identified in the application and registrations are the same, or closely related, and 
support the present refsual.
 
For the reasons discussed above, registration must be refused under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.

REGISTRATION
 
Additionally, a mark in a prior-filed pending application may present a bar to registration of applicant’s 
mark.
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 90700949 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.

Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
