NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a),2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues 
 
Prior Pending application SN 97119262
Disclaimer
Identification of services in Class 41
Specimen in Class 41
 
Prior Pending
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO's database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no similar registered marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 
2(d). TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). However, a mark in a prior-filed pending application 
may present a bar to registration of applicant's mark.
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No(s). 97119262 precede(s )applicant's filing date.  
See attached referenced application(s).  If the mark(s) in the referenced application register(s), 
applicant's mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood 
of confusion between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  
Therefore, upon receipt of applicant's response to this Office action, action on this application may be 
suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application(s). 
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant's mark and the mark(s) in the referenced 
application.  Applicant's election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant's right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
Disclaimer 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording "CONSULTING GROUP" because it merely describes an 
ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant's services, and thus is 
an unregistrable component of the mark. See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(e)(1), 1056(a); DuoProSS Meditech 
Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 
2004)); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The applicant's mark comprises, in part, the terms CONSULTING GROUP, each of which immediately 
informs the purchasers of an aspect of the goods and services and are therefore descriptive. The term 
CONSULTING GROUP refers to the exact nature of the applicant's services and is therefore generic as 
shown by the attached definition.
 
An applicant may not claim exclusive rights to terms that others may need to use to describe its goods 
and/or services in the marketplace. See Dena Corp. v. Belvedere Int'l, Inc., 950 F.2d 1555, 1560, 21 
USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 1991); In re Aug. Storck KG, 218 USPQ 823, 825 (TTAB 1983). A 
disclaimer of unregistrable matter does not affect the appearance of the mark; that is, a disclaimer does 
not physically remove the disclaimed matter from the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 
340 F.2d 978, 978, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213.If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire mark. 
See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1040-41, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1088-89 (Fed. Cir. 2005); TMEP 
§1213.01(b).
 
Identification of services 
 
The bolded portion(s) of the identification of services is unacceptable and must be clarified because  it 
either lacks sufficient specificity and/or is too broad and/or is mis-classified. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.01.  Generally, applicant must amend the identification to specify the common 
commercial or generic name of the services. See TMEP §1402.01. If the services have no common 
commercial or generic name, applicant must describe or explain the nature of the services using clear 
and succinct language. See id.  Some suggestions are embedded in the identification and are in italics. 
 
Applicant may adopt any or all of the suggestions so long as they are accurate. If applicant does not 
adopt a suggestion, then applicant must amend the identification so that it is as specific as the 
suggestions or the language found in the U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
The current identification of services in Class 41 is:
 
International Class 041: Education and training in the field of business management; asset 
management; and credit building 
 
The "education" is not acceptable as the means must be identified, e.g. classes and seminars. The 
current identification of services aslo requires a change in punctuation because as written, the semi-
colons separates the "asset management" and "credit building" fields from the training services.  
Separated, they are not services in Class 41.  The following may be adopted, if accurate:
 
International Class 041: Education in the nature of classes and training in the fields of business 
management, asset management, and credit building 
 
If the "asset management" is a separate service, it may be amended to "financial asset management" in 
Class 36.  Also, if the credit building services is a separate service, applicant must further describe it, 
e.g credit building consulting services in Class 36. 
 
Applicant's services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those originally 
itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. 
Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting items to 
result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods and/or 
services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original application or 
as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or services sets the 
outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of 
the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any acceptable changes to the 
goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services are deleted, they are not 
permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).Multiple class application requirements 
 
The application references services based on use in commerce in more than one international class; 
therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) 
already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in more 
classes than those for which fees have been paid.  Applicant must either (a) submit the 
filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) restrict the application to 
the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for class(es) 36; and applicant needs a specimen for any additional class(es). 
See more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.       
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or 
advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce 
on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as 
early as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c). 
 
Specimen does not show use of mark with services 
 
Specimen does not show use of the mark in commerce. Registration is refused because the specimen 
does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce in International Class(es) 41. 
Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP 
§§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a 
specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of 
services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R.§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Specifically, there is no reference to any educational services.  Nothing on the specimen evidences the 
association between the mark and the services in Class 41.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).  Any webpage printout or 
screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or 
printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified 
statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); 
TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
