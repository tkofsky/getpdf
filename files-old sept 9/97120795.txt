NONFINAL OFFICE ACTIONThe USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Registration is Refused: Likelihood of Confusion
•
Identification of Goods and Services Requires Amendment
•
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 5919353 for the standard character mark SKILLSONIQ. Trademark Act Section 
2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark SONICJOBS in stylized text with a design of a target for
International Class 009: Downloadable mobile applications relating to recruitment services; electronic 
downloadable databases for use in the field of recruitment; software applications for searching a 
database of job listings
International Class 035: Personnel placement and recruitment services; employment agency services; 
personnel placement and recruitment via the internet, mobile telephones and mobile devices; 
computerized file management for recruitment; compilation of job information into computer 
databases; advertising services provided over the Internet all related to job listings, employment,recruitment and personnel placement; compilation of advertisements for use as web pages over the 
Internet and digital marketing all related to job listings, employment, recruitment and personnel 
placement; testing individuals to determine employment skills; professional consultancy and expert 
services, all relating to personnel vocational testing and career advice; compilation and updating of 
databases of recruitment information; providing an on-line searchable database featuring job listings, 
recruitment information and resumes 
 
Registrant’s mark is SKILLSONIQ in standard characters for: 
International Class 035: online employment recruitment site for employers to hire and manage workers; 
Employment hiring, recruiting, placement, staffing and career networking services; Human resource 
services, namely, providing feedback from individuals and from organizations; providing an online 
portal for submitting and posting of resumes and profiles by professionals and posting of work 
opportunities by individuals and companies. 
 
Similarity of the Marks
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
The applied-for mark is SONICJOBS in stylized form with a target design. The registered mark is 
SKILLSONIQ in standard character form. Stylization of the one of the marks at issue will not avoid 
likelihood of confusion.  
 
A mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in any lettering style; the rights reside in the 
wording or other literal element and not in any particular display or rendition. See In re Viterra Inc., 
671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 
1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. §2.52(a); TMEP §1207.01(c)(iii). Thus, a 
mark presented in stylized characters and/or with a design element generally will not avoid likelihood 
of confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters because the word portion could be presented 
in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 1909; 
Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that “the 
argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable where one party asserts rights in no 
particular display”).
 
Further, when evaluating a composite mark consisting of words and a design, the word portion is 
normally accorded greater weight because it is likely to make a greater impression upon purchasers, be 
remembered by them, and be used by them to refer to or request the goods and/or services. In re 
Aquitaine Wine USA, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1181, 1184 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 
1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(c)(ii). Thus, although marks 
must be compared in their entireties, the word portion is often considered the dominant feature and is 
accorded greater weight in determining whether marks are confusingly similar, even where the word 
portion has been disclaimed. In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1366-67, 101 USPQ2d at 1911 (citing Giant 
Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ2d 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 
1983)).The marks at issue share the highly similar and phonetically equivalent components SONIC and 
SONIQ. See attached evidence regarding phonetic equivalence. Marks may be confusingly similar in 
appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the compared 
marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial 
Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 
(Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH confusingly similar); In re Corning 
Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly 
similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 1983) (holding MILTRON and 
MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
The term SONIC forms the first and therefore dominant feature of the mark. Consumers are generally 
more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any trademark or service mark. See Palm 
Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 
USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE 
CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the 
mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 
970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding similarity between CENTURY 21 
and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because “consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead 
word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 
2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial words is particularly significant because 
consumers typically notice those words first”). The term "SONIC" is thus given greater weight in 
comparing the marks.
 
The marks are therefore found similar.
 
The examining attorney further notes where the goods and services of an applicant and registrant are 
“similar in kind and/or closely related,” the degree of similarity between the marks required to support 
a finding of likelihood of confusion is not as great as in the case of diverse goods and/or services.  In re 
J.M. Originals Inc., 6 USPQ2d 1393, 1394 (TTAB 1987); see Shen Mfg. Co. v. Ritz Hotel Ltd., 393 
F.3d 1238, 1242, 73 USPQ2d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2004); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Comparison of the Goods and Services
The goods and services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or 
travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
When analyzing an applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services for similarity and relatedness, that 
determination is based on the description of the goods and/or services in the application and registration 
at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use. See Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital 
LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1323, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Octocom Sys. Inc. v. 
Hous. Computers Servs. Inc., 918 F.2d 937, 942, 16 USPQ2d 1783, 1787 (Fed. Cir. 1990)). 
 
Applicant's goods and services are "Downloadable mobile applications relating to recruitment services; 
electronic downloadable databases for use in the field of recruitment; software applications for 
searching a database of job listings" in International Class 009, and "Personnel placement and 
recruitment services; employment agency services; personnel placement and recruitment via theinternet, mobile telephones and mobile devices; computerized file management for recruitment; 
compilation of job information into computer databases; advertising services provided over the Internet 
all related to job listings, employment, recruitment and personnel placement; compilation of 
advertisements for use as web pages over the Internet and digital marketing all related to job listings, 
employment, recruitment and personnel placement; testing individuals to determine employment skills; 
professional consultancy and expert services, all relating to personnel vocational testing and career 
advice; compilation and updating of databases of recruitment information; providing an on-line 
searchable database featuring job listings, recruitment information and resumes" in International Class 
035. 
 
Registrant’s services are "online employment recruitment site for employers to hire and manage 
workers; Employment hiring, recruiting, placement, staffing and career networking services; Human 
resource services, namely, providing feedback from individuals and from organizations; providing an 
online portal for submitting and posting of resumes and profiles by professionals and posting of work 
opportunities by individuals and companies" in International Class 035.
 
In this case, the services in the application and registration(s) are legally identical in part. Therefore, it 
is presumed that the channels of trade and class(es) of purchasers are the same for these goods and/or 
services. See Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1372, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 
2018) (quoting In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012)). 
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods and/or services are related.
 
Further, the compared goods and services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood 
of confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 
1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots from a representative sampling of third party 
websites, establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant 
goods and services and markets the goods and services under the same mark. See attached screenshots 
from ZipRecruiter.com, RobertHalf.com, Apple.com, and SparksGroupInc.com. This evidence also 
shows that the relevant goods and services are sold or provided through the same trade channels and 
used by the same classes of consumers in the same fields of use, and the goods and/or services are 
similar or complementary in terms of purpose or function.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods 
and/or services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey 
Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 
1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Accordingly, the goods and services are considered related. 
 
Conclusion
Because the marks are similar and the goods and services are related and legally identical in part there 
is a likelihood of confusion as to the source of applicant’s goods and services, and registration is 
refused pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
If applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below.

number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
