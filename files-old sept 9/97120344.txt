NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SUMMARY OF ISSUES:

SEARCH RESULT
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS 
 
Some of the identification of goods are indefinite and must be clarified.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.01.  Applicant must amend the identification to specify the common commercial or 
generic name of the goods.  See TMEP §1402.01.  If the goods have no common commercial or generic 
name, applicant must describe the product, its main purpose, and its intended uses.  See id.
 
The identification of goods contains parentheses. Generally, an applicant should not use parentheses 
and brackets, including curly brackets, in identifications in order to avoid confusion with the USPTO’s 
practice of using parentheses and brackets in registrations to indicate (1) goods and/or services that 
have been deleted from registrations, (2) goods and/or services not claimed in an affidavit of 
incontestability, or (3) guidance to users of the USPTO’s U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and 
Services Manual to draft an acceptable identification. See TMEP §§1402.04, 1402.12. The only 
exception for including parenthetical information in identifications is if it serves to explain or translate 
the matter immediately preceding the parenthetical phrase in such a way that it does not affect the 
clarity or scope of the identification, e.g., “fried tofu pieces (abura-age).” See TMEP §1402.12.
 
Therefore, applicant must remove the parentheses from the identification and incorporate any 
parenthetical or bracketed information into the description of the goods.
 
In addition, the wording “including” in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be deleted. See 
37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03(a). The identification must be specific and all-
inclusive. This wording is an open-ended term (e.g.,  “such as”) that is not acceptable because it fails to 
identify specific goods. See TMEP §1402.03(a).
 
For easier reference, the suggested amendments are shown in bold and italics.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Folding briefcases, shoulder bags, Gladstone bags, briefcases, suitcases, carry-on bags, tote 
bags, trunks being luggage, handbags, Boston bags, schoolchildren's backpacks, backpacks in the 
nature of rucksacks, credit card cases, textile shopping bags, wheeled shopping bags, purses not of 
precious metal, key cases, wallets not of precious metal, commuter's-pass holders in the nature ofmass transit card cases, business card cases, vanity cases, not fitted, umbrellas and their parts, 
parasols, industrial packaging containers of leather, clothing for domestic pets, walking sticks, canes, in 
international class 18;
 
Clothing, one-piece dresses, jackets, clothing of leather, namely, (SPECIFY type of clothing, e.g., 
leather jackets, leather pants, etc.), suits, vests, coats, sweatshirts, trousers and pants, shirts, polo 
shirts, blouses, dresses, skirts, t-shirts, nightwear, underwear, evening gowns, sweaters, cardigans, 
overalls, garters, belts for clothing, waistbands, suspenders, neckties, scarves, hosiery, shoes, athletic 
shoes, overshoes, headgear for wear, namely, hats and caps being headwear, gloves, swimwear, 
boots, masquerade costumes, in international class 25.
 
Please note the parentheticals denote place(s) where the applicant must provide acceptable 
identifications.  Any identification must be incorporated into the identification without the use of 
parentheticals or brackets. 
sho
Applicant’s goods may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those originally 
itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. 
Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting items to 
result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods or add 
goods not found or encompassed by those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 
TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification 
and is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP 
§§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any acceptable changes to the goods will further limit scope, and once 
goods are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, 
please see the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services 
Manual. See TMEP §1402.04.  To expedite prosecution of this trademark application, when 
amending the identification as required above, the Office strongly encourages the applicant to 
select pre-approved wording contained within this manual that accurately describes the goods 
and/or services therein.  Failure to do so may result in delay.
 
CONSENT
 
Applicant must clarify whether the name JUNYA WATANABE in the mark identifies a particular 
living individual. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§813, 1206.03. In this case, the application neither 
specifies whether the name in the mark identifies a particular living individual nor includes a written 
consent. See TMEP §§813.01(a)-(b), 1206.04(a), 1206.05.  In addition, although the applicant claims 
ownership of prior registrations containing the same name that shows a consent statement, in this case, 
the applicant did not state that the consent is of record therein.  TMEP § 1206.04(c).
 
To register a mark that consists of or comprises the name of a particular living individual, including a 
first name, pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, an applicant must provide a written consent 
personally signed by the named individual. 15 U.S.C. §1052(c); TMEP §§813, 1206.04(a).
 
Accordingly, if the name in the mark does not identify a particular living individual, applicant 
must submit a statement to that effect (e.g., “The name shown in the mark does not identify a particular 
living individual.”).However, if the name in the mark does identify a particular living individual, applicant must 
submit both of the following:
 
(1)        The following statement: “The name(s) shown in the mark identifies a 
living individual(s) whose consent(s) to register is made of record.” If the name is a 
pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, applicant must provide the following statement: 
“JUNYA WATANABE identifies (specify name), a living individual whose consent is of 
record.”
 
(2)        A written consent, personally signed by the named individual(s), as follows: 
“I, (specify name), consent to the use and registration of my name, JUNYA WATANABE, 
as a trademark and/or service mark with the USPTO.”
 
For an overview of the requirements for names appearing in marks, and instructions on how to satisfy 
this requirement using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see 
the Name/Portrait/Signature of Particular Living Individual in Mark webpage.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
BASIS
 
The application specifies both an intent to use basis under Trademark Act Section 1(b) and a claim of 
priority under Section 44(d) based on a foreign application. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 1126(d); 37 
C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2), (a)(4). However, no copy of a foreign registration has been provided even though 
the application indicates applicant’s intent to rely on Section 44(e) as an additional basis for 
registration. See 15 U.S.C. §1126(e).
 
An application with a Section 44(e) basis must include a true copy, photocopy, certification, or certified 
copy of a foreign registration from an applicant’s country of origin. 15 U.S.C. §1126(e); 37 C.F.R. 
§2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP §§1004, 1004.01, 1016. In addition, an applicant’s country of origin must be a 
party to a convention or treaty relating to trademarks to which the United States is also a party, or must 
extend reciprocal registration rights to nationals of the United States by law. 15 U.S.C. §1126(b); 
TMEP §§1002.01, 1004.
 
Therefore, applicant must provide a copy of the foreign registration from applicant’s country of origin 
when it becomes available. TMEP §1003.04(a). A copy of a foreign registration must consist of a 
document issued to an applicant by, or certified by, the intellectual property office in applicant’s 
country of origin. TMEP §1004.01. If applicant’s country of origin does not issue registrations or 
Madrid Protocol certificates of extension of protection, applicant may submit a copy of the Madrid 
Protocol international registration that shows that protection of the international registration has been 
extended to applicant’s country of origin. TMEP §1016. In addition, applicant must also provide an 
English translation if the foreign registration is not written in English. 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3)(ii); TMEP 
§1004.01(a)-(b). The translation should be signed by the translator. TMEP §1004.01(b).If the foreign registration has not yet issued, or applicant requires additional time to procure a copy of 
the foreign registration (and English translation, as appropriate), applicant should so inform the 
trademark examining attorney and request that the U.S. application be suspended until a copy of the 
foreign registration is available. TMEP §§716.02(b), 1003.04(b).
 
If applicant cannot satisfy the requirements of a Section 44(e) basis, applicant may request that the 
mark be approved for publication based solely on the Section 1(b) basis. See 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b), 
1126(e); 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §§806.02(f), 806.04(b), 1003.04(b). Although the mark may be 
approved for publication on the Section 1(b) basis, it will not register until an acceptable allegation of 
use has been filed. See 15 U.S.C. §1051(c)-(d); 37 C.F.R. §§2.76, 2.88; TMEP §1103. Please note that, 
if the U.S. application satisfied the requirements of Section 44(d) as of the U.S. application filing date, 
applicant may retain the priority filing date under Section 44(d) without perfecting the Section 44(e) 
basis, provided there is a continuing valid basis for registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(3)-(4); TMEP 
§§806.02(f), 806.04(b).
 
Alternatively, applicant has the option to amend the application to rely solely on the Section 44(e) basis 
and request deletion of the Section 1(b) basis. See 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(1); TMEP §806.04. The foreign 
registration alone may serve as the basis for obtaining a U.S. registration. See 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3); 
TMEP §806.01(d).
 
DISCLAIMER
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “MAN” because it is merely descriptive of a purpose or use of 
applicant’s goods.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 
695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove the 
disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213.
 
MAN refers to a male.  Please see the attached definitions.  The goods may be used or intended for use 
by men.  Therefore, the wording is not a source indicator of the goods.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “MAN” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
DECLARATION
 
The application was unsigned, resulting in the application not being properly verified. See TMEP §804. 
Applicant must properly sign and therefore verify the application in an affidavit or signed declaration 
under 37 C.F.R. §2.20. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.2(n), 2.33(a), (b)(2)-(c), 2.34(a)(2), (a)(3)(i), (a)(4)(ii); 
TMEP §804.02.The following statements must be verified: That applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in 
commerce and had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the application filing date; 
that applicant believes applicant is entitled to use the mark in commerce on or in connection with the 
goods or services specified in the application; that to the best of the signatory’s knowledge and belief, 
no other persons, except, if applicable, concurrent users, have the right to use the mark in commerce, 
either in the identical form or in such near resemblance as to be likely, when used on or in connection 
with the goods/services of such other persons, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive; and that the 
facts set forth in the application are true. 37 C.F.R. §§2.33(b)(2), (c), 2.34(a)(2), (a)(3)(i), (a)(4)(ii).
 
For more information about the verified statement and instructions on providing one using the online 
Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see the Verified statement webpage.
 
SIGNIFICANCE OF WORDING
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must explain whether the wording “EYE” in 
the mark has any significance in the bag and clothiing trade or industries or as applied to applicant’s 
goods, or if such wording is a term of art within applicant’s industry. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP 
§814. If the wording has no significance and is not a term of art in the relevant trade or industry or as 
used with applicant’s goods, applicant must provide a statement to that effect. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); 
TMEP §814.
 
To respond to this requirement for information, open the appropriate Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS) response form and enter the serial number, answer “yes” to question 3, and provide the 
information on the “Additional Statement(s)” page in the “Significance of Wording, Letter(s), or 
Numeral(s)” text box(es) in the form.
 
Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an independent ground for refusing 
registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 (TTAB 2021) (citing In re 
Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 
1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
