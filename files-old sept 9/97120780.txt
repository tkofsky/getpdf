NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Mark On Drawing Differs From Mark On Specimen - Class 28
•
Requirement: Disclaimer
•
 
MARK ON DRAWING DIFFERS FROM MARK ON SPECIMEN - CLASS 28
The stated refusal refers to International Class 28 only and does not bar registration in the other class. 
 
Mark shown on drawing does not match mark on specimen. Registration is refused because the 
specimen does not show the mark in the drawing in use in commerce in International Class 28, which is 
required in the application or amendment to allege use. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). The mark 
appearing on the specimen and in the drawing must match; that is, the mark in the drawing “must be a 
substantially exact representation of the mark” on the specimen. See 37 C.F.R. §2.51(a)-(b); TMEP 
§807.12(a).
 
In this case, the Class 28 specimen showing the skateboard deck displays the mark as merely HELL 
SICK. However, the drawing displays the mark as HELL SICK SKATEBOARDS. The mark on the 
specimen does not match the mark in the drawing because the specimen lacks the word 
SKATEBOARDS. Applicant has thus failed to provide the required evidence of use of the mark in 
commerce. See TMEP §807.12(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) for each 
applicable international class that (a) shows the mark in the drawing in actual use in 
commerce for the goods in the application or amendment to allege use, and (b) was in 
actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated 
with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage 
specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in 
association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the 
webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within 
the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. 
§2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP 
§§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).(2)        Submit a request to amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 
1(b) (which includes withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no 
specimen is required before publication. This option will later necessitate additional 
fee(s) and filing requirements such as providing a specimen.
 
The USPTO will not accept an amended drawing submitted in response to this refusal because the 
changes would materially alter the drawing of the mark in the original application or as previously 
acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.72(a)-(b); TMEP §807.14. Specifically, although the goods in 
Class 28 are skateboard decks, the goods in Class 25 are not (they are clothing), and therefore this 
wording SKATEBOARDS has an effect on the commercial impression of the overall mark, and 
shortening the mark to HELL SICK would remove a wording that has significance in the mark.  
Applicant cannot therefore amend the mark to HELL SICK - it would be considered a material 
amendment.
 
For more information about drawings and instructions on how to satisfy these response options using 
the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Drawing webpage.  
 
Although applicant's mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “SKATEBOARDS” because it is merely descriptive of an 
ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods.  See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The 
attached 
evidence 
from 
the 
Merriam-Webster 
dictionary 
shows 
this 
wording 
SKATEBOARDS means "a short board mounted on small wheels that is used for coasting and for 
performing athletic stunts".  Thus, the wording merely describes applicant’s goods because they are 
skateboard decks or clothing used when skateboarding or for skateboarders.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:
 
    No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “SKATEBOARDS” apart from the mark as 
shown.
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant isencouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for 
more information.
 
Assistance available. Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions 
about this Office action. Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining 
attorney can provide additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office 
action. See TMEP §§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
