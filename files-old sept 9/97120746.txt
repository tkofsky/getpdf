NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issues below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks and 
found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
However, applicant must respond to the issues set forth below.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive 
•
Identification of Services - Partially Indefinite
•
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE 
 
Registration 
is 
refused 
because 
the 
applied-for 
mark 
merely 
describes 
a purpose 
of 
applicant’s services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 
1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services.  TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson 
LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 
1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of 
Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)). 
 
In the present case, applicant has applied to register the mark “TEST DEBT” for use in connection with 
“AI-powered software as a service (SAAS) testing platform.”
 
According to the attached evidence, the wording “test debt” (or technical debt) commonly refers to, 
generally, the needs of software test automation surpassing the time or capacity available to meet those 
needs.” See attached evidence.  Applicant's website states, "Functionize has been an AI company from 
day one. Our approach has been to apply machine learning and other AI approaches to solve the 
problems with test debt." (Emphasis added) See attached evidence.
 
Therefore, the mark TEST DEBT, merely describes the purpose of applicant’s services, namely, to 
improve test automation by reducing testing maintenance and increasing overall test coverage.  
Accordingly, the proposed mark is merely descriptive, and registration is refused on the Principal 
Register under Section 2(e)(1) of the Lanham Act.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTER - ADVISORY  
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register. Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816. Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant 
from submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal(s). TMEP §816.04.  
 
IDENTIFICATION OF  SERVICES 
 
The identification for software in International Class 42 is indefinite and must be clarified to specify the 
purpose or function of the software and its content or field of use, if content- or field- specific. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). The USPTO requires such specificity in order for 
a trademark examining attorney to examine the application properly and make appropriate decisions 
concerning possible conflicts between the applicant’s mark and other marks. See In re N.A.D. Inc., 57 
USPQ2d 1872, 1874 (TTAB 2000); TMEP §1402.03(d).
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate (please note that suggested amendments 
are in bold italics and suggested deletions are in strikethrough):
 
International Class 42
 
"AI-powered software as a service (SAAS) testing platform featuring software for __{indicate 
function of software, e.g., database management, etc.}."
 
Applicant’s services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those originally 
itemized in the application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06.  
Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting items to 
result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods and/or 
services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original application or 
as acceptably amended.  See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b).  The scope of the goods and/or services sets the 
outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of 
the wording in the identification.  TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b).  Any acceptable changes to the 
goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services are deleted, they are not 
permitted to be reinserted.  TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.

Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
