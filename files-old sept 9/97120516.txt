Identification of Services – Amendment Required
•
Advisory regarding Hiring a Trademark Attorney
•
 
Deferred Action on the Merits and Search
 
The trademark examining attorney will defer a review of the merits of the application and a search of 
the USPTO database of registered and pending marks for potentially conflicting marks until applicant 
responds to the issues raised in this Office action. TMEP §704.02.
 
Identification of Services – Amendment Required 
 
Applicant must clarify the entire wording in the identification of services in International Class 
39 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This 
wording is indefinite because it does not make clear what the services are. Further, this wording could 
identify goods and services in more than one international class.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
International Class 6: Storage pallets of metal
•
 
International Class 7: Storage machinery, namely, a vertical hoist for raising and storing 
recreational equipment, sporting goods and household items elevated from ground level 
•
 
International Class 9: Distribution transformers 
•
 
International Class 11: Storage heaters 
•
 
International Class 12: Truck bed storage organizers; Self-driving delivery robots 
•
 
International Class 19: Non-metal storage sheds 
•
 
International Class 20: Storage tanks, not of metal or masonry 
•
 
International Class 28: Storage racks for athletic equipment 
•
 
International Class 35: Freight logistics management, namely third party logistics; Freight 
logistics management, namely fourth party logistics; Transportation logistics services, namely, 
arranging the transportation of goods for others; Distribution of advertising material; 
Monitoring deliveries for business purposes 
•
 
International Class 36: Financial customs brokerage services; Mutual fund distribution 
•
 
International Class 38: Electronic delivery of images and photographs via a global computer 
network 
•
 
International Class 39: Freight forwarding; Supply chain logistics and reverse logistics 
•services, namely, storage, transportation and delivery of goods for others by air, rail, ship or 
truck; Delivery and storage of goods; Distribution of gas; Warehousing services, namely, 
storage, distribution, pick-up, and packing for shipment of documents, packages, raw 
materials, and other freight for others; Global transportation of freight for others by all 
available means 
 
International Class 41: Distribution of motion picture films 
•
 
International Class 42: Electronic storage of files and documents; Transportation and traffic 
planning services
•
 
If applicant adopts the suggested amendment of the identification of goods and services, then applicant 
must amend the classification to International Classes 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 19, 20, 28, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41 and 
42. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(7), 2.85; TMEP §§805, 1401.  
 
Classification of goods and services is a purely administrative matter within the sole discretion of the 
USPTO. See In re Faucher Indus. Inc., 107 USPQ2d 1355, 1357 (TTAB 2013) (quoting In re Tee-Pak, 
Inc., 164 USPQ 88, 89 (TTAB 1969)).
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).  
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
Multiple Class Application Requirements for a Section 1(b) Application 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee already 
paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). The application identifies goods 
and services that are classified in at least 14 classes; however, applicant submitted a 
fee sufficient for only 1 class. Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes 
not covered by the submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes 
covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
Advisory regarding Hiring a Trademark Attorney 
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for 
more information.
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120516
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
