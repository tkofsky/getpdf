SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Domicile Address Required 
•
 
DOMICILE ADDRESS REQUIRED 
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record identifies a 
post office box or mail forwarding service and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal place 
of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP 
§601.01(b)(1); https://locations.theupsstore.com/ca/la-jolla/7660-h-fay-ave (showing 
the 
address 
provided is mailing store with mailbox services). A domicile address must identify either (1) the 
permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an individual applicant resides and intends to be 
the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal place of business, which is the juristic applicant’s 
headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  
See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a). All applications must include the applicant’s domicile 
address, which is required for a complete application. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.22(a)(1), 2.32(a)(2), 2.189.
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile 
as a post office box or mail forwarding service instead of a street address. In most cases, a post office 
box or mail forwarding service is not acceptable as a domicile address because it does not identify the 
location of applicant’s headquarters where the entity’s senior executives or officers ordinarily direct 
and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1).
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide (1) documentation showing that the listed 
address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that applicant has no 
fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §601.01(b)-(b)(1).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s domicile address. Applicant should provide the 
most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP 
§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status &

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
