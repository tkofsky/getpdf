System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
Introduction
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Summary of Issues
 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusal 
•
Advisory regarding Ownership of Cited Registration(s)
•
 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion Refusal 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 4945355 and 5947793. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see 
TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registrations.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark PEACE LOVE & PLUFF MUD in standard characters for 
“T-shirts; T-shirts for apparel; Graphic T-shirts; Short-sleeved or long-sleeved t-shirts; Tee shirts” in 
International Class 25.
 
The mark in U.S. Reg. No. 4945355 is PLUFF MUD LOVE in standard characters for “Body and 
beauty care cosmetics; Body masks; Cosmetic masks; Facial beauty masks; Facial masks; Lotions forface and body care; Non-medicated cleansers for personal use, namely, MUD MASK; Non-medicated 
cleansers, namely, mud mask; Non-medicated skin care creams and lotions; Non-medicated skin care 
preparations; Non-medicated skin care preparations, namely, creams, lotions, gels, toners, cleaners and 
peels; Skin lotion; Skin lotions; Skin masks; Skin moisturizer” in International Class 3.
 
The mark in U.S. Reg. No. 5947793 is ORIGINAL PLUFF MUD  in standard characters for 
“Clothing, namely, shirts, hats and pants” in International Class 25. 
 
Similarity of the Marks 
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
Here, applicant’s mark, PEACE LOVE & PLUFF MUD, is confusingly similar to the registered marks, 
PLUFF MUD LOVE and ORIGINAL PLUFF MUD, because they share the wording "PLUFF MUD." 
Applican'ts mark and the registered mark in Reg. No. 4945355, PLUFF MUD LOVE, also share the 
term "LOVE." 
 
Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases or similar parts of 
terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall commercial impression. See 
Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 228 USPQ 689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), 
aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 811 F.2d 1490, 
1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding COMMCASH and COMMUNICASH 
confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM 
and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 
1983) (holding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii). In 
this case, the marks create a similar commercial impression because the same wording PLUFF 
MUD appears in the compared marks.
 
Because the marks look and sound similar and create the same overall commercial impression, the 
marks are considered similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.
 
Relatedness of the Goods 
 
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods and/or services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of 
confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 
(Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 
TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstancessurrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
U.S. Registration No. 4945355 
 
Here, applicant’s goods, “T-shirts; T-shirts for apparel; Graphic T-shirts; Short-sleeved or long-sleeved 
t-shirts; Tee shirts,” are closely related to registrant’s goods, “Body and beauty care cosmetics; Body 
masks; Cosmetic masks; Facial beauty masks; Facial masks; Lotions for face and body care; Non-
medicated cleansers for personal use, namely, MUD MASK; Non-medicated cleansers, namely, mud 
mask; Non-medicated skin care creams and lotions; Non-medicated skin care preparations; Non-
medicated skin care preparations, namely, creams, lotions, gels, toners, cleaners and peels; Skin lotion; 
Skin lotions; Skin masks; Skin moisturizer.” 
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots from the webpages of Armani, Dior, and 
Avon, establishes that the same entity commonly manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant 
goods and markets the goods under the same mark. Specifically, it shows that entities that commonly 
make or sell skincare products, like the registrant, commonly also make or sell T-shirts, like the 
applicant.  In other words, consumers are accustomed to seeing both applicant’s and registrant’s goods 
provided under the same mark.  As a result, the use of confusingly similar marks for both applicant’s 
and registrant’s goods is likely to result in consumer confusion. Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods 
are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes. See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 
USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 
1271-72 (TTAB 2009). 
 
Accordingly, the goods are considered related for purposes of the likelihood of confusion analysis. 
 
U.S. Registration No. 5947793 
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the registration uses broad wording to describe "shirts," which presumably encompasses all 
goods of the type described, including applicant’s more narrow "T-shirts; T-shirts for apparel; Graphic 
T-shirts; Short-sleeved or long-sleeved t-shirts; Tee shirts." See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 
USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 
(TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills 
Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. 
Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 
USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are related for purposes of the likelihood of 
confusion analysis.
 
Conclusion
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods are related and/or legally identical, there is a likelihood of 
confusion as to the source of applicant’s goods, and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(d) of 
the Trademark Act.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
