SPECIMEN REFUSED
 
Specimen is not an acceptable webpage display. Registration is refused because the specimen in 
International Class(es) 16 is not acceptable as a display associated with the goods and does not show 
the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. 
§§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §2.56(a), (b)(1); see TMEP §§904, 904.03(g)-(i), 904.07(a). An application 
based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as 
actually used in commerce for each international class of goods identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a).
 
A webpage or catalog display specimen (1) must show use of the mark directly associated with the 
goods and (2) such use must be of a point-of-sale nature. 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1). This means that this 
type of display specimen must include the following:
 
(1)        A picture or sufficient textual description of the goods;
 
(2)        The mark associated with the goods; and
 
(3)        A means for ordering the goods such as a “shopping cart” button/link, an 
order form, or a telephone number for placing orders.
 
See In re Sones, 590 F.3d 1282, 1286-89, 93 USPQ2d 1118, 1122-24 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re Azteca 
Sys., Inc., 102 USPQ2d 1955, 1957-58 (TTAB 2012); In re Dell Inc., 71 USPQ2d 1725, 1727 (TTAB 
2004); Lands’ End v. Manbeck, 797 F. Supp. 511, 514, 24 USPQ2d 1314, 1316 (E.D. Va. 1992); 
TMEP §904.03(h), (i)-.03(i)(D).
 
In this case, the specimen does not show a picture or textual description of the actual goods that may be 
purchased or a sufficient means for ordering the goods. Specifically, the applicant's website appears to 
discuss the types of products it offered, but the specimen does not show the actual goods that are 
available or how to order them.A specimen with a telephone number, internet address, and/or mailing address that appears only with 
corporate contact information may not show sufficient means for ordering the goods. See In re 
Genitope Corp., 78 USPQ2d 1819, 1822 (TTAB 2006); TMEP §904.03(i)(C)(2). In that circumstance, 
the specimen may also need to include instructions on how to place an order or an offer to accept 
orders. See In re Quantum Foods, Inc., 94 USPQ2d 1375, 1379 (TTAB 2010); TMEP 
§904.03(i)(C)(2). In this case, the telephone number and email address for "sales" is only a means for 
gathering more information related to the goods and is not a means for actually ordering them.
 
Accordingly, such material is mere advertising, which is not acceptable as a specimen for goods. See In 
re Yarnell Ice Cream, LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 265039, at *15-16 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re Siny Corp., 
920 F.3d 1331, 1336, 2019 USPQ2d 127099, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. 2019)); see also Avakoff v. S. Pac. Co., 
765 F.2d 1097, 1098, 226 USPQ 435, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1985); TMEP §904.04(b), (c).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  As specified above, a webpage specimen submitted as a display associated 
with the goods must show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and 
include information necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), 
(c).  Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL 
and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the 
specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed 
response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to therefusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
 
APPLICATION NOT SIGNED 
 
The application was unsigned, resulting in the application not being properly verified. See TMEP §804. 
Applicant must properly sign and therefore verify the application in an affidavit or signed declaration 
under 37 C.F.R. §2.20. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.2(n), 2.33(a)-(b)(1), (c), 2.34(a)(1)(i); TMEP §804.02.
 
The following statements must be verified: That applicant believes applicant is the owner of the mark; 
that the mark is in use in commerce and was in use in commerce as of the application filing date; that to 
the best of the signatory’s knowledge and belief, no other persons, except, if applicable, concurrent 
users, have the right to use the mark in commerce, either in the identical form or in such near 
resemblance as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods/services of such other 
persons, to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive; that the specimen shows the mark as used on or 
in connection with the goods or services as of the application filing date; and that the facts set forth in 
the application are true. 37 C.F.R. §§2.33(b)(1), (c), 2.34(a)(1)(i), 2.59(a).
 
For more information about the verified statement and instructions on providing one using the online 
Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see the Verified statement webpage.
 
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
 
The wording “corrugated paper and cardboard point-of-sale displays, both bearing printing and those 
having no printing thereon, namely, counter displays, floor displays, pop-up displays, standee displays, 
pallet displays, dump displays, powerwing display, and box displays” in the identification of goods for 
International Class 16 must be clarified because it is too broad and could include goods in other 
international classes. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. In particular, this wording 
could encompass goods that are in the nature of furniture, which are in Class 20, and the "dump 
displays" may include "carts", which are in Class 12. As shown in bold type below, the applicant also 
needs to include the purpose of the goods. ee 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.
 
The wording “standee” in the identification of goods is a registered mark not owned by applicant; 
accordingly, applicant must amend the identification to delete this wording and, if not already included 
in the identification, provide the common commercial or generic name of the goods. TMEP §1402.09; 
see 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); Camloc Fastener Corp. v. Grant, 119 USPQ 264, 264 n.1 (TTAB 1958). See 
attached U.S. Registration No. 4344068.
 
Identifications of goods should generally be comprised of generic everyday wording for the goods, and 
exclude proprietary or potentially-proprietary wording, such as a registered term. See TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.09. The misspelling or phonetic equivalent of a registered mark should similarly be 
excluded, unless it is the common name of the goods. TMEP §1402.09. A registered mark indicates 
origin in one particular party and so may not be used to identify goods and/or services that originate in 
a party other than that registrant. TMEP §1402.09 (citing Camloc Fastener Corp. v. Grant, 119 USPQ 
at 264 n.1).
 
Applicant may replace such wording with the following, if appropriate: “cardboard floor display units 
for merchandising products” or "display stands", in Class 20.Also, applicant must correct the punctuation in the identification to clarify the individual items in the 
list of goods and/or services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01(a). Proper punctuation in 
identifications is necessary to delineate explicitly each product or service within a list and to avoid 
ambiguity. Commas, semicolons, and apostrophes are the only punctuation that should be used in an 
identification of goods and/or services. TMEP §1402.01(a). An applicant should not use colons, 
periods, exclamation points, and question marks in an identification. Id. In addition, applicants should 
not use symbols in the identification such as asterisks (*), at symbols (@), or carets. Id.
 
In general, commas should be used in an identification (1) to separate a series of related items 
identified within a particular category of goods or services, (2) before and after “namely,” and (3) 
between each item in a list of goods or services following “namely” (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion, bar soap, shampoo). Id. Semicolons generally should be used to separate a series 
of distinct categories of goods or services within an international class (e.g., personal care products, 
namely, body lotion; deodorizers for pets; glass cleaners). Id.
 
Thus, applicant should replace the term "and" after "cardboard" with a semi-colon, if the paper and 
cardboard are separate goods from the point-of-sale displays. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:
 
Class 12 
 
Carts being dump displays of corrugated paper and cardboard for merchandising 
products, both bearing printing and those having no printing thereon 
 
Class 16 
 
Paper, cardboard; and corrugated paper and cardboard point-of-sale displays for 
merchandising products, both bearing printing and those having no printing thereon, 
namely, counter displays, floor displays, pop-up displays in the nature of {specify form, 
e.g. banners or boxes}, standee displays, pallet displays, dump displays being boxes, 
powerwing display, and box displays 
 
Class 20 
 
Corrugated paper and cardboard point-of-sale displays for merchandising products, both 
bearing printing and those having no printing thereon, namely, floor displays, standee 
displays stands, pallet displays being display stands, dump displays being floor displays, 
powerwing display being floor display stands, and box displays 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS
 
If applicant adopts the suggested amendment of the identification of goods, then applicant must amend 
the classification to International Classes 12, 16 and 20. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(7), 2.85; TMEP 
§§805, 1401.
 
The USPTO follows the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the 
Registration of Marks (also called the “Nice Classification” system), established by the World 
Intellectual Property Organization, to organize and classify goods and services for the purpose of 
registering marks. Nice Classification has 45 numbered classes with class headings that describe in 
broad terms the types of goods and services in each class. See 37 C.F.R. §2.85(a); TMEP §§1401.02, 
1401.02(a).
 
An applicant must adopt the appropriate international classification number for the goods and/or 
services identified in the application. “Proper classification allows for administrative recordkeeping, 
enables accurate and efficient public searches of USPTO records, and facilitates examination of 
applications filed with the USPTO by aligning fees with costs.” In re Carlton Cellars, LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 10150, at *2 (TTAB 2020).
 
Classification of goods and services is a purely administrative matter within the sole discretion of the 
USPTO. See In re Faucher Indus. Inc., 107 USPQ2d 1355, 1357 (TTAB 2013) (quoting In re Tee-Pak, 
Inc., 164 USPQ 88, 89 (TTAB 1969)).
 
 
MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
 
The application references goods based on use in commerce in more than one international class; 
therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) 
already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 3 classes; however, 
applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 class. Applicant must either (a) submit the 
filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) restrict the application to 
the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
not acceptable for any international class. See more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actualgoods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce 
on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as 
early as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(a) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
Fees for Additional Classes
 
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.

Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
