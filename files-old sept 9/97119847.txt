NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Officeaction.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Pending Section 2(d) Refusal – Prior-Filed Application
•
Section 2(d) Refusal – Likelihood of Confusion
•
 
PRIOR-FILED APPLICATION
 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 79336077 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application.  If the mark in the referenced application registers, applicant’s mark 
may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood of confusion 
between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  Therefore, 
upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be suspended 
pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues.
 
While applicant is not required to respond to the issue of the pending application, applicant must 
respond to the following refusal within six months of the mailing date of this Office action to avoid 
abandonment. 
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 5142797. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Standard of Analysis for Section 2(d) Refusal 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Facts 
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark MIDNIGHT MUSE for use on “Bras; Panties” in 
International Class 25. 
 
Registrant’s mark is MIDNIGHTMUSE for “Jewelry.” in International Class 14. 
 
Similarity of Marks  
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
The compared marks are identical except for a slight difference in appearance between registrant’s 
mark, which appears as a compound word with no space separating the words, that is, 
MIDNIGHTMUSE; and applicant’s mark, which appears as multiple words with space separating the 
words, that is, MIDNIGHT MUSE. As such, the marks are identical in sound and virtually identical in 
appearance, and are thus confusingly similar for the purposes of determining likelihood of confusion. 
See, e.g., Seaguard Corp. v. Seaward Int’l, Inc., 223 USPQ 48, 51 (TTAB 1984) (“[T]he marks 
‘SEAGUARD’ and ‘SEA GUARD’ are, in contemplation of law, identical [internal citation 
omitted].”); In re Best W. Family Steak House, Inc., 222 USPQ 827, 827 (TTAB 1984) (“There can be 
little doubt that the marks [BEEFMASTER and BEEF MASTER] are practically identical”); Stock Pot, 
Inc., v. Stockpot Rest., Inc., 220 USPQ 52, 52 (TTAB 1983), aff’d 737 F.2d 1576, 222 USPQ 665 (Fed. 
Cir. 1984) (“There is no question that the marks of the parties [STOCKPOT and STOCK POT] are 
confusingly similar. The word marks are phonetically identical and visually almost identical.”).  
 
Relatedness of Goods 
 
The compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods and/or services] 
emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369,101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Where the marks of the respective parties are identical or virtually identical, as in this case, the degree 
of similarity or relatedness between the goods needed to support a finding of likelihood of confusion 
declines. See In re Country Oven, Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 443903, at *5 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), aff’d, 866 F.3d 1315, 123 USPQ2d 1744 
(Fed. Cir. 2017)); TMEP §1207.01(a); see also In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1207, 26 USPQ2d 
1687, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 1993).
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of screenshots of third-party websites, establishes that the 
same entity commonly provides the relevant goods under the same mark, through the same trade 
channels, which are used by the same classes of consumers in the same fields of use.   Thus, applicant’s 
and registrant’s goods are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re 
Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 
USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
In conclusion, because the marks are virtually identical and the goods are related, there is a likelihood 
of confusion as to the source of applicant’s goods.  Therefore, registration is refused pursuant to 
Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.

to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed

“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
