NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicantmust respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Section 2(d) Partial Refusal – Likelihood of Confusion
•
Requirement: Identification of Goods and Services 
•
Advisory: Partial Abandonment
•
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
The stated refusal refers to International Class 16 only and does not bar registration in the other class.
 
Applicant seeks to register SUPERLIFE for, in relevant part:
  
International Class 016: Printed pamphlets, brochures, manuals, books, booklets, leaflets, 
informational flyers, informational sheets and newsletters, adhesive backed stickers, and kits 
comprised solely of one or more of the foregoing materials in the field of health, wellness and 
nutrition
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the 
mark SUPER LIFE SECRET CODES in U.S. Registration Nos. 5732989. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 
15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
SIMILARITY OF THE MARKS 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In reDavia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
When comparing marks, “[t]he proper test is not a side-by-side comparison of the marks, but instead 
whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that 
[consumers] who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.” 
Cai v. Diamond Hong, Inc., 901 F.3d 1367, 1373, 127 USPQ2d 1797, 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting 
Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 
2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b). The proper focus is on the recollection of the average purchaser, who 
retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks. In re Ox Paperboard, LLC, 2020 
USPQ2d 10878, at *4 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 
(TTAB 2016)); In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018); TMEP 
§1207.01(b); see In re St. Helena Hosp., 774 F.3d 747, 750-51, 113 USPQ2d 1082, 1085 (Fed. Cir. 
2014).  
 
Applicant has applied for the standard character mark SUPERLIFE and the cited registration is the 
standard character mark SUPER LIFE SECRET CODES.  The marks are identical except applicant 
deletes the space and the last two words, resulting in marks that retain a highly similar appearance, 
sound, and connotation.  This results in marks with an overall similar commercial impression.
 
 
Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first word, prefix, or syllable in any trademark 
or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 
F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between VEUVE 
ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a ‘prominent 
feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 Real Estate 
Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) (finding 
similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because “consumers 
must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1303, 
128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial words is 
particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”).  Here the marks being 
with the same wording.
 
In addition, although applicant’s mark does not contain the entirety of the registered mark, applicant’s 
mark is likely to appear to prospective purchasers as a shortened form of registrant’s mark. See In re 
Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting United States 
Shoe Corp., 229 USPQ 707, 709 (TTAB 1985)). Thus, merely omitting some of the wording from a 
registered mark may not overcome a likelihood of confusion. See In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 
1342, 94 USPQ2d 1257; In re Optica Int’l, 196 USPQ 775, 778 (TTAB 1977); TMEP §1207.01(b)(ii)-
(iii). In this case, applicant’s mark does not create a distinct commercial impression from the registered 
mark because it contains some of the wording in the registered mark and does not add any wording that 
would distinguish it from that mark.  
 
Because the marks are similar in appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression, the marks 
are confusingly similar. 
 
RELATEDNESS OF THE GOODS 
 
The applicant identifies the following goods:International Class 016: Printed pamphlets, brochures, manuals, books, booklets, leaflets, 
informational flyers, informational sheets and newsletters, adhesive backed stickers, and kits 
comprised solely of one or more of the foregoing materials in the field of health, wellness and 
nutrition
 
Registrant identifies the following goods: 
 
International Class 016: books on the subject of self help for personal and financial success in life 
 
The compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods and/or services] 
emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The attached Internet evidence, consisting of third parties that provide printed books in the field of 
health, nutrition, wellness and personal success in life, establishes that the same entity commonly 
manufactures, produces, or provides the relevant goods and markets the goods under the same mark, 
the relevant goods are sold or provided through the same trade channels and used by the same classes 
of consumers in the same fields of use, and the goods are similar or complementary in terms of purpose 
or function.
 
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  
See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. 
Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Because the marks are confusingly similar and the goods are related, there is a likelihood of confusion 
to relevant consumers, and therefore registration is refused. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below. 
 
REQUIREMENT: IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “kits comprised solely of one or more of the foregoing materials” in 
the identification of goods in International Class 16 because the use of "one or more" results in an 
indefinite identification.  Applicant must also clarify the wording “Entertainment services, namely, an 
ongoing series featuring the subject of health, wellness and nutrition provided through production and 
distribution of an ongoing television series” in the identification of goods in International Class 41 
because the use of "one or more" results in an indefinite identification.applicant is ambiguous as to 
whether it is providing an ongoing series or providing a production and distribution service.
 See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.  
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate (additions are shown in bold, deletions arein strike-through):
 
International Class 016: Printed pamphlets, brochures, manuals, books, booklets, leaflets, informational 
flyers, informational sheets and newslettersin the field of health, wellness and nutrition; adhesive 
backed stickers; in the field of health, wellness and nutrition; kits comprised solely of printed 
pamphlets, brochures, manuals, books, booklets, leaflets, informational flyers, informational sheets and 
newsletters in the field of health, wellness and nutrition and adhesive backed stickers 
 
International Class 041: Entertainment services, namely, an ongoing series featuring the subject of 
health, wellness and nutrition provided through television; Entertainment services, namely, production 
and distribution of an ongoing television series featuring the subject of health, wellness and nutrition
 
International Class 044: Providing a website featuring information about health, wellness and nutrition 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).

have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
