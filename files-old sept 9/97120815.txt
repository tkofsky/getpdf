NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Officeaction.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) Refusal to Register  
 
The stated refusal refers to the following goods and/or services only: “Research and development in the 
fields of natural resources and carbon capture technologies.” It does not bar registration for the other 
goods and/or services.
 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the marks in 
U.S. Registration Nos. 6749006, 5992984, 5753847, 5471831, 5440307, and 3239943. 
Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq. See the attached 
registrations.
In any likelihood of confusion determination, two key considerations are similarity of the marks and 
similarity or relatedness of the goods and/or services. In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 
1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 
1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976)); see TMEP §1207.01. That is, the marks are compared in 
their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression. In re 
Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting In re E. I. du 
Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). Additionally, the goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they 
are similar or commercially related or travel in the same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. 
Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); 
Herbko Int'l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); 
TMEP §1207.01, (a)(vi).
 
A. The Marks  
 
The applicant seeks to register “PROJECT VESTA,” and the registered marks are “VESTS,” 
"VESTAS 
ANTI-ICING 
SYSTEM," 
"VESTAS 
PURE. 
PERFORMANCE," 
"VESTAS 
TURBINEPLUS," "VESTAS LIFEPLUS," and "VESTAS."     The marks are similar because 
they include VESTA or VESTAS.An applied-for mark that is the singular or plural form of a registered mark is essentially identical in 
sound, appearance, meaning, and commercial impression, and thus the marks are confusingly similar. 
Swiss Grill Ltd., v. Wolf Steel Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 2001, 2011 n.17 (TTAB 2015) (holding “it is obvious 
that the virtually identical marks [the singular and plural of SWISS GRILL] are confusingly similar”); 
Weider Publ’ns, LLC v. D & D Beauty Care Co., 109 USPQ2d 1347, 1355 (TTAB 2014) (finding the 
singular and plural forms of SHAPE to be essentially the same mark) (citing Wilson v. Delaunay, 245 
F.2d 877, 878, 114 USPQ 339, 341 (C.C.P.A. 1957) (finding no material difference between the 
singular and plural forms of ZOMBIE such that the marks were considered the same mark).
 
When comparing marks, the test is not whether the marks can be distinguished in a side-by-side 
comparison, but rather whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their overall commercial 
impression that confusion as to the source of the goods and/or services offered under the respective 
marks is likely to result. Midwestern Pet Foods, Inc. v. Societe des Produits Nestle S.A., 685 F.3d 1046, 
1053, 103 USPQ2d 1435, 1440 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Bay State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d 1958, 1960 
(TTAB 2016) (quoting Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1368, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 2012)); TMEP §1207.01(b). The proper focus is on the recollection of 
the average purchaser, who retains a general rather than specific impression of trademarks. In re Bay 
State Brewing Co., 117 USPQ2d at 1960 (citing Spoons Rests. Inc. v. Morrison Inc., 23 USPQ2d 1735, 
1741 (TTAB 1991), aff'd per curiam, 972 F.2d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1992)); In re C.H. Hanson Co., 116 
USPQ2d 1351, 1353 (TTAB 2015) (citing Joel Gott Wines LLC v. Rehoboth Von Gott Inc., 107 
USPQ2d 1424, 1430 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
B. The Goods/Services  
 
The applicant uses its mark (in relevant part) in connection with "Research and development in the 
fields of natural resources and carbon capture technologies,” and the registered mark is used 
development of goods in the field of wind power technology.  The goods/services of the parties are 
related because wind power development is development in the field of natural resources.
.  
The goods and/or services of the parties need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood 
of confusion.   See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc. , 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 
1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton , 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 
2000) ( “ [E]ven if the goods in question are different from, and thus not related to, one another in kind, 
the same goods can be related in the mind of the consuming public as to the origin of the goods. ” ); 
TMEP § 1207.01(a)(i).  
 
The respective goods and/or services need only be “ related in some manner and/or if the circumstancessurrounding their marketing [be] such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source. ”   Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC , 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler , 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP § 1207.01(a)(i).
 
Based on the similarity of the marks and relatedness of the goods/services, consumers are likely to be 
confused by the marks into believing that the goods/services of the parties share a common source or 
sponsorship.  
 
Applicant may respond to the stated refusal by submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal. 
In addition, applicant may respond by doing one of the following:
 
(1) Deleting the goods and/or services to which the refusal pertains;
 
(2) Filing a Request to Divide Application form (form #3) to divide out the goods and/or services 
that have not been refused registration, so that the mark may proceed toward publication for 
opposition for those goods or services to which the refusal does not pertain. See 37 C.F.R. §2.87. 
See generally TMEP §§1110 et seq. (regarding the requirements for filing a request to divide). If 
applicant files a request to divide, then to avoid abandonment, applicant must also file a timely 
response to all outstanding issues in this Office action, including the refusal. 37 C.F.R. §2.87(e).; 
or
 
(3) Amending the basis for the goods and/or services identified in the refusal, if appropriate. 
TMEP §806.03(h). (The basis cannot be changed for applications filed under Trademark Act 
Section 66(a). TMEP §1904.01(a).)
 
 
Disclaimer
 
If applicant responds to the refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth 
below.
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “PROJECT” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, 
quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant's goods and/or services.  See 15 
U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence from Merriam-Webster online dictionary shows this wording means a planned 
undertaking.  Thus, the wording merely describes applicant’s goods and/or services which are a based 
on a planned research study.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “PROJECT” apart from the mark as shown.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
