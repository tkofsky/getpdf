Applicant:  Sweats and The City, Inc.
Reference/Docket No. N/A
Correspondence Email Address:  zoe@zoebernsteinlaw.comNONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Section 2(d) - Likelihood of Confusion
•
Prior-Filed Application
•
Identification of Services 
•
 
Registration Refused - Section 2(d) Likelihood of Confusion
 
This refusal applies only to International Class 38.
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 5778809. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration ("Exhibit A").
 
The applied-for mark is "ORRO" in standard characters for "Audio, video, and audiovisual 
broadcasting services over the Internet or other communications network, namely, transmission 
of live and video-on-demand fitness classes and meditation classes to mobile phones, tablets, 
computers, Internet-capable televisions, and digital media streaming devices; streaming of 
health, exercise, fitness, physical training and personal development classes and interactive 
classes" in International Class 38.
 
The registered mark is "OROS" in standard characters for "Electronic transmission of messages" in 
International Class 38 and "On-line social networking services" in International Class 45. 
 
In this case, the following factors are the most relevant: similarity of the marks, similarity and nature of 
the goods and services, and similarity of the trade channels of the goods and services.  See In re Viterra 
Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
Comparison of Marks
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these 
elements may be sufficient to find the marks confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 
USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d 
per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 (Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).In this instance, the applied-for mark "ORRO" and the registered mark "OROS" are similar in sound 
and appearance. Although the applied-for mark contains two R's, the root term "ORRO" and 
"ORO" could clearly be pronounced the same. Thus, a consumer audibly encountering the marks are 
likely to perceive and pronounce the marks as the singular and plural version of the term "ORO". An 
applied-for mark that is the phonetic equivalent of the singular form of a registered mark is essentially 
identical in sound and appearance, and thus the marks are confusingly similar. Swiss Grill Ltd., v. Wolf 
Steel Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 2001, 2011 n.17 (TTAB 2015) (holding “it is obvious that the virtually 
identical marks [the singular and plural of SWISS GRILL] are confusingly similar”).
 
Based on the foregoing, the applied-for mark and registered mark are sufficiently similar to find a 
likelihood of confusion.
 
Comparison of Services
The compared services need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the services] 
emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 
101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 
(TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Here, the services at issue are related because the services commonly emanate from the same 
commercial entity. In support thereof, the examining attorney has attached Internet evidence from 
providers of audio and video streaming services ("Exhibit B"). This evidence establishes that the same 
entity, such as UScreen, commonly provides online platforms for the streaming and transmission of 
audio and video content, messaging, and social networking under the same mark, which are marketed 
and provided through the same trade channels and used by the same classes of consumers.  
 
Thus, the services of the applicant and registrant are considered related for likelihood of confusion 
purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009).
 
Conclusion
Because the applied-for mark and the registered mark are similar and the services are related, 
registration is refused for a likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d).
 
Advisory: Applicant's Response Options 
Applicant may respond to the stated refusal by submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal.  
In addition, applicant may respond by doing one of the following:
 
(1)  Deleting the class to which the refusal pertains;
 
(2)  Filing a Request to Divide Application form (form #3) to divide out the services that have 
not been refused registration, so that the mark may proceed toward publication for opposition in 
the class to which the refusal does not pertain.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.87.  See generally TMEP 
§§1110 et seq. (regarding the requirements for filing a request to divide).  If applicant files a 
request to divide, then to avoid abandonment, applicant must also file a timely response to all 
outstanding issues in this Office action, including the refusal.  37 C.F.R. §2.87(e).If applicant responds to the refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below. 
 
 
Prior-Filed Application 
The filing date of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 90873106 precedes applicant’s filing date.  See 
attached referenced application ("Exhibit C").  If the mark in the referenced application registers, 
applicant’s mark may be refused registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d) because of a likelihood 
of confusion between the two marks.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); 37 C.F.R. §2.83; TMEP §§1208 et seq.  
Therefore, upon receipt of applicant’s response to this Office action, action on this application may be 
suspended pending final disposition of the earlier-filed referenced application.
 
In response to this Office action, applicant may present arguments in support of registration by 
addressing the issue of the potential conflict between applicant’s mark and the mark in the referenced 
application.  Applicant’s election not to submit arguments at this time in no way limits applicant’s right 
to address this issue later if a refusal under Section 2(d) issues. However, the applicant must address 
the other issues raised in this Office action.
 
 
Identification of Services
The wording “streaming of health, exercise, fitness, physical training and personal development classes 
and interactive classes” in the identification of services in International Class 38 is indefinite and must 
be clarified because the applicant does not sufficiently specify the nature and/or where the content is 
being streamed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. For example, an acceptable amendment to 
this entry would clarify that the applicant is providing the streaming of audio and video content on the 
Internet or that the streaming is of audio and video tethered downloads. Thus, where indicated, the 
applicant must revise its identification to clarify the nature of its streaming services.
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification of services, if accurate. The examining attorney has 
bolded and underlined additions to the applicant’s original identification of services.
 
Class 038:       Audio, video, and audiovisual broadcasting services over the Internet or other 
communications network, namely, transmission of live and video-on-demand fitness classes and 
meditation classes to mobile phones, tablets, computers, Internet-capable televisions, and digital media 
streaming devices; streaming of audio and video material on the internet, namely, health, exercise, 
fitness, physical training and personal development classes and interactive classes
 
Class 041:       Conducting fitness classes; Physical fitness consultation; Physical fitness instruction; 
Providing on-line interactive health, exercise, fitness, physical training and personal development 
classes on an interactive website via mobile phones and Internet 
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the services, but not to broaden or expand the 
services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); 
TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted services may not later be reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
