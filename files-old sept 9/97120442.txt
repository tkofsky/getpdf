INTRODUCTION
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
REFUSAL - SECTION 2(d) - LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
•
REQUIREMENT - TRANSLATION 
•
REQUIREMENT - IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS
•
 
REFUSAL - SECTION 2(d) - LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
THIS PARTIAL REFUSAL APPLIES ONLY TO THE GOODS SPECIFIED THEREIN  
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark(s) in 
the following U.S. Registration(s):
 
Reg. No. 3209146 (“FORESTER” in standard character form for “Wood burning stoves”) 
•
This partial refusal applies only to applicant's "camping stove." 
•
Reg. No. 5606049 (“SKÖGGS” in stylized text for goods including “Athletic apparel, namely, 
shirts, pants, jackets, footwear, hats and caps, athletic uniforms”) 
•
This partial refusal applies only to applicant's "cap." 
•
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached 
registration(s).
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that so resembles a registered mark 
that it is likely a potential consumer would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the source of the 
goods and/or services of the applicant and registrant.  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  A determination of 
likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d) is made on a case-by case basis and the factors set forth in 
In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) aid 
in this determination.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d 1344, 1349, 98 USPQ2d 
1253, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citing On-Line Careline, Inc. v. Am. Online, Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1085, 56 
USPQ2d 1471, 1474 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).  Not all the du Pont factors, however, are necessarily relevant or 
of equal weight, and any one of the factors may control in a given case, depending upon the evidence of 
record.  Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Grp., Inc., 637 F.3d at 1355, 98 USPQ2d at 1260; In re 
Majestic Distilling Co., 315 F.3d 1311, 1315, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see In re E. I. 
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d at 1361-62, 177 USPQ at 567.In this case, the following factors are the most relevant:  similarity of the marks, similarity and nature 
of the goods and/or services, and similarity of the trade channels of the goods and/or services.  See In re 
Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1361-62, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Dakin’s 
Miniatures Inc., 59 USPQ2d 1593, 1595-96 (TTAB 1999); TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.
 
Comparison of the Marks
 
Applicant’s applied-for mark is “SKOGSMAN” in standard character form. The marks in the 
registrations are indicated above.
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F. 3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.”  In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014) (citing In re 1st USA Realty 
Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007)); In re White Swan Ltd., 8 USPQ2d 1534, 1535 
(TTAB 1988)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
The mark in Reg. No. 3209146 is "FORESTER" and the attached evidence from Translate.com, 
YourDictionary and TechDico shows that the word "SKOGSMAN" translates to "forester" in 
English.Under the doctrine of foreign equivalents, a mark in a common, modern foreign language and a 
mark that is its English equivalent may be held confusingly similar. TMEP §1207.01(b)(vi); see, e.g., 
In re Aquamar, Inc., 115 USPQ2d 1122, 1127-28 (TTAB 2015); In re Thomas, 79 USPQ2d 1021, 1025 
(TTAB 2006). Consequently, marks comprised of foreign wording are translated into English to 
determine similarity in meaning and connotation with English word marks. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. 
Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1377, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1696 
(Fed. Cir. 2005). Equivalence in meaning and connotation may be sufficient to find such marks 
confusingly similar. See In re Aquamar, Inc., 115 USPQ2d at 1127-28; In re Thomas, 79 USPQ2d at 
1025.
 
Applicant’s mark is in Swedish, which is a common, modern language in the United States. The 
doctrine is applied when “the ordinary American purchaser” would “stop and translate” the foreign 
term into its English equivalent. Palm Bay, 396 F.3d at 1377, 73 USPQ2d at 1696 (quoting In re Pan 
Tex Hotel Corp., 190 USPQ 109, 110 (TTAB 1976)); TMEP §1209.03(g). The ordinary American 
purchaser includes those proficient in the foreign language. In re Spirits Int’l, N.V., 563 F.3d 1347, 
1352, 90 USPQ2d 1489, 1492 (Fed. Cir. 2009); see In re Highlights for Children, Inc., 118 USPQ2d at 
1271. In this case, the ordinary American purchaser would likely stop and translate the mark because 
the Swedish language is a common, modern language spoken by an appreciable number of consumers 
in the United States. Specifically the attached evidence from Babbel Magazine and Routes North shows 
that this language is spoken by a sizeable word population and an appreciable number of U.S. 
consumers in the United States. Furthermore this Swedish wording translates directly to a common 
English word describing types of camping product users and the attached evidence from 
applicant's Etsy storefront page shows that the applicant actually provides a translation of the word on 
the webpage stating that "SKOGSMAN" is "Translated From Scandinavian languages" followed by the 
word "forester." Therefore, under the doctrine of foreign equivalents, these two marks are confusingly 
similar due to their having the same meaning.With respect to the comparison of the applied-for mark and the mark in Reg. No. 5606049, although 
marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or dominant in 
creating a commercial impression. See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 
1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Matter that is descriptive of or generic for a party’s 
goods and/or services is typically less significant or less dominant in relation to other wording in a 
mark. See Anheuser-Busch, LLC v. Innvopak Sys. Pty Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1816, 1824-25 (TTAB 2015) 
(citing In re Chatam Int’l Inc., 380 F.3d 1340, 1342-43, 71 USPQ2d 1944, 1946 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). In 
the present case, given that the goods in question for the likelihood of confusion determination are the 
applicant's "caps," the "MAN" portion of the mark is less significant in terms of affecting the mark’s 
commercial impression since it simply identifies that the intended wearers of the goods are men, and 
therefore renders the "SKOGS" portion the more dominant element of the mark.
 
Further reinforcing the dominance of the "SKOGS" portion of the applicant's mark is the fact that this 
portion appears first in the mark. Consumers are generally more inclined to focus on the first syllable in 
any trademark or service mark. See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee 
En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding similarity between 
VEUVE ROYALE and two VEUVE CLICQUOT marks in part because “VEUVE . . . remains a 
‘prominent feature’ as the first word in the mark and the first word to appear on the label”); Century 21 
Real Estate Corp. v. Century Life of Am., 970 F.2d 874, 876, 23 USPQ2d 1698, 1700 (Fed Cir. 1992) 
(finding similarity between CENTURY 21 and CENTURY LIFE OF AMERICA in part because 
“consumers must first notice th[e] identical lead word”); see also In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 
1297, 1303, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding “the identity of the marks’ two initial 
words is particularly significant because consumers typically notice those words first”).
 
The wording in Reg. No. 5606049, "SKÖGGS", and the dominant portion of the applicant's mark, 
"SKOGS" are visually very similar and essentially phonetic equivalent and thus sound similar. 
Similarity in sound alone may be sufficient to support a finding that the compared wording is 
confusingly similar. In re 1st USA Realty Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007) (citing 
Krim-Ko Corp. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 390 F.2d 728, 732, 156 USPQ 523, 526 (C.C.P.A. 1968)); 
TMEP §1207.01(b)(iv).
 
The mark in Reg. No. 5606049 is in stylized text, however, the applicant's mark is in standard character 
form. A mark in typed or standard characters may be displayed in any lettering style; the rights reside 
in the wording or other literal element and not in any particular display or rendition. See In re Viterra 
Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1363, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1909 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601 F.3d 
1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 37 C.F.R. §2.52(a); TMEP §1207.01(c)(iii). 
Thus, a mark presented in stylized characters and/or with a design element generally will not avoid 
likelihood of confusion with a mark in typed or standard characters because the word portion could be 
presented in the same manner of display. See, e.g., In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d at 1363, 101 USPQ2d at 
1909; Squirtco v. Tomy Corp., 697 F.2d 1038, 1041, 216 USPQ 937, 939 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that 
“the argument concerning a difference in type style is not viable where one party asserts rights in no 
particular display”). As such, the dominant "SKOGS" portion of the applicant's mark could be 
displayed in the same exact font and stylization as how the phonetically equivalent and visually similar 
 "SKÖGGS" appears in the registered mark.
 
As such, viewed as a whole, applicant’s mark is confusingly similar to the registered marks.
 
Comparison of the GoodsThe relevant goods from the application and registrations are listed further above.
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the application uses the broad wording "caps" to describe their goods, which presumably 
encompasses all goods  of the type described, including the more narrow "athletic apparel, namely, ... 
caps" identified in Reg. No. 5606049.  See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 
1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  
Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s these of goods are legally identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 
127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 
648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 
USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 
1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods and/or services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of 
trade, or classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same 
class of purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 
1005 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, these of applicant’s and registrant’s goods are related.
 
With respect to the goods in Reg. No. 2309146  of the parties need not be identical or even competitive 
to find a likelihood of confusion.  See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 
56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 
1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (“[E]ven if the goods in question are different from, and thus not related to, 
one another in kind, the same goods can be related in the mind of the consuming public as to the origin 
of the goods.”); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). 
 
The respective goods and/or services need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances 
surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods 
and/or services] emanate from the same source.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 
F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 
USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
The attached Internet evidence consists of screenshots of products from TOAKS, TMS, US Stove, 
WINNERWELL and Ironclad Supply shows that the same entities manufacture stoves that are wood 
burning and also portable so that they can be used when camping. This evidence establishes that the 
same entity commonly manufactures the relevant goods and markets the goods under the same mark, 
the relevant goods are sold or provided through the same trade channels and used by the same classes 
of consumers in the same fields of use and also that  the goods are similar or complementary in terms of 
purpose or function since the language used in both the applicant's and registrant's identification is 
commonly used to describe the same singular piece of equipment.  Therefore, applicant’s and 
registrant’s goods are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey 
Prods. Pty Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 
1266, 1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
REQUIREMENT - TRANSLATION 
 
To permit proper examination of the application, applicant must submit an English translation of all 
wording in the mark because it is foreign wording. 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(9), 2.61(b); TMEP §809. The 
following is suggested: The English translation of “SKOGSMAN” in the mark is “forester”. 
TMEP §809.03. See the attached translation evidence. 
 
REQUIREMENT - IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS 
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “camping kettle” in the identification of goods  in International 
Class 28 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. 
This wording is indefinite because it does not make clear what the goods are. Further, this wording 
could identify goods in more than one international class. For example, electric camping kettles are in 
International Class 11 and non-electric camping kettles are in International Class 21.
 
The wording “potable” presented as part of "camping stove potable" in the identification of goods 
appears to be a typographical error and is thus indefinite; the spelling must be corrected or the wording 
further clarified. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01(a). Applicant may substitute the following 
wording for the incorrect spelling, if accurate: “portable.” Additionally, these types of portable camping 
stove goods are classified incorrectly. Applicant must amend the application to classify the goods in 
International Class 11. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(7), 2.85; TMEP §§1401.02(a), 1401.03(b).
 
The wording “Magnesium Ferro Flint Fire Starter” in the identification of goods is indefinite and must 
be clarified because this appears to be a Magnesium Ferro flint used for starting fires but that is not 
immediately clear from the current language. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant 
may substitute the following wording, if accurate: “Magnesium Ferro flint used as a fire starter.” These 
goods are also classified incorrectly. Applicant must amend the application to classify the goods in 
International Class 34. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(7), 2.85; TMEP §§1401.02(a), 1401.03(b).
 
The wording “camping knife” is classified incorrectly. Applicant must amend the application to classify 
the goods in International Class 8. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(7), 2.85; TMEP §§1401.02(a), 
1401.03(b). The suggested amendment below also substitutes the plural "camping knives" for the 
current singular version of the items.
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “cap” in the identification of goods  in International Class 28 
because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This 
wording is indefinite because it does not make clear what the goods are. Further, this wording could 
identify goods in more than one international class. For example, surgical caps are in International 
Class 10, non-metal bottle caps are in International Class 20 and caps being headwear are in 
International Class 25. Based on the additional wording in the identification of goods, the suggested 
amendment below only provides caps being headwear in International Class 25 but if applicant is 
providing other types of "caps" then these can also be substitute into the identification of goods. For 
further assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please 
see the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.Applicant should note that any wording in bold, in italics, underlined and/or in ALL CAPS below 
offers guidance and/or shows the changes being proposed for the identification of goods and/or 
services.  If there is wording in the applicant’s version of the identification of goods and/or services 
which should be removed, it will be shown with a line through it such as this: strikethrough.  When 
making its amendments, applicant should enter them in standard font, not in bold, in italics, underlined 
or in ALL CAPS.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 8: Camping knives
 
Class 11: Electric camping kettles, portable camping stoves
 
Class 21: Non-electric camping kettles
 
Class 25: Caps being headwear
 
Class 34: Magnesium Ferro flint used as a fire starter
 
See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.
 
An applicant may only amend an identification to clarify or limit the goods, but not to add to or 
broaden the scope of the goods.  37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); see TMEP §§1402.06 et seq., 1402.07. Generally, 
any deleted goods may not later be reinserted.  See TMEP §1402.07(e). 
 
Advisory – Multiple Class Application
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that 
are classified in at least 5 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 
class(es).  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the 
submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already 
paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120442
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
