NONFINAL OFFICE ACTIONThe USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive
•
Advisory: Supplemental Register Option
•
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature or characteristic of 
applicant’s goods.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 
1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s goods 
and/or services, not in the abstract. DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 
675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b). “Whether 
consumers could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the 
test.” In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).
 
Here, applicant has applied for the mark CLEANSING ESSENTIALS in standard characters for use in 
connection with "Body oils; Skin conditioners; Skin lotions; Bar soap; Bath soaps; Beauty soap; Body 
scrub; Body scrubs; Body cream soap; Cosmetic soaps; Cream soaps; Exfoliating scrubs for cosmetic 
purposes; Facial scrubs; Foot scrubs; Hand scrubs; Perfumed soap; Perfumed soaps; Shaving soaps; 
Skin soap" in Class 3.  The attached evidence from Merriam-Webster dictionary shows that 
"cleanse" means to "clean" or "to rid of impurities by or as if by washing," "essential" means 
"something basic," and "essential oil" means "any of a class of volatile oils that give plants theircharacteristic odors and are used especially in perfumes and flavorings, and for aromatherapy."  
Moreover, the attached evidence from HD Soap, Seek Spark Shine, Starflower Essentials, and Thirteen 
Lune shows that the wording "cleansing" and "essential" or "essentials" is often used in connection 
with similar goods to mean that the goods are used for cleaning and are made with essential oils.  Thus, 
the wording merely describes a feature or characteristic of applicant's goods because applicant's goods 
are used for cleaning and are made with essential oils.  In fact, the attached evidence from applicant’s 
website states that applicant's skincare line "includes soaps handcrafted with essential oils" and 
applicant's face oil "will cleanse, treat, and naturally moisturize your skin."  (Emphasis added).  
Therefore, applicant's goods are, in fact, used for cleansing and are made with essential oils.
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods and/or services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not 
registrable. In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re 
Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as 
hypodermic, aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 
(TTAB 2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner 
that is an integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services is the combined mark 
registrable. See In re Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial 
Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 
364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result, as described above, are 
descriptive of applicant’s goods and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in 
relation to the goods. Specifically, the term CLEANSING conveys that applicant's goods are used for 
cleaning, the term ESSENTIALS conveys that applicant's goods are made with essential oils, and the 
combination of the terms CLEANSING ESSENTIALS conveys that applicant's goods include essential 
oils and are used for cleaning.
 
Ultimately, when purchasers encounter applicant’s goods using the mark CLEANSING ESSENTIALS, 
they will immediately understand the mark as an indication of a feature or characteristic of applicant’s 
goods and not an indication that applicant is the source of the goods.  Therefore, the mark is merely 
descriptive and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act. 
 
ADVISORY: SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTER OPTION
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register. Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816. Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant 
from submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal(s). TMEP §816.04.

Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
