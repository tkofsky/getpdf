NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03. 
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKSThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Specimen does not Show Direct Association Between Mark and Services
•
Identification of Services 
•
 
SPECIMEN DOES NOT SHOW DIRECT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MARK AND 
SERVICES
 
Registration is refused because the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and fails to show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the identified 
services in International Class 041. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 
C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (b)(2); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(f)(ii), (g)(i). An application 
based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as 
actually used in commerce for each international class of services identified in the application or 
amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 
904.07(a).
 
When determining whether a mark is used in connection with the services in the application, a key 
consideration is the perception of the user. In re JobDiva, Inc., 843 F.3d 936, 942, 121 USPQ2d 1122, 
1126 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., 686 F.3d 1376, 1381-82, 103 
USPQ2d 1672, 1676 (Fed Cir. 2012)). A specimen must show the mark used in a way that would create 
in the minds of potential consumers a sufficient nexus or direct association between the mark and the 
services being offered. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2); In re Universal Oil Prods. Co., 476 F.2d 653, 655, 
177 USPQ2d 456, 457 (C.C.P.A. 1973); TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii).
 
To show a direct association, specimens showing the mark used in rendering the identified services 
need not explicitly refer to those services, but “there must be something which creates in the mind of 
the purchaser an association between the mark and the service activity.” In re The Cardio Grp., LLC, 
2019 USPQ2d 227232, at *1 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re WAY Media, LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1697, 1698 
(TTAB 2016)).
 
In the present case, the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and services in 
that the information services are not clear. Furthermore, the applied-for mark is used in the specimen as 
a tool to explain how applicant carries out their services under the "EXERSIDES" mark.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).  Any webpage printout or 
screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or 
printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified 
statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); 
TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for eachapplicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES
 
The identification of services is indefinite and must be clarified according to the explanations and 
suggestions below. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. The identification of goods and/or 
services contains parentheses. Generally, an applicant should not use parentheses and brackets, 
including curly brackets, in identifications in order to avoid confusion with the USPTO’s practice of 
using parentheses and brackets in registrations to indicate (1) goods and/or services that have been 
deleted from registrations, (2) goods and/or services not claimed in an affidavit of incontestability, or 
(3) guidance to users of the USPTO’s U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual to 
draft an acceptable identification. See TMEP §§1402.04, 1402.12. The only exception for including 
parenthetical information in identifications is if it serves to explain or translate the matter immediately 
preceding the parenthetical phrase in such a way that it does not affect the clarity or scope of the 
identification, e.g., “fried tofu pieces (abura-age).” See TMEP §1402.12.
 
Therefore, applicant must remove the parentheses from the identification and incorporate any 
parenthetical or bracketed information into the description of the goods and/or services.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, with additions shown in bold and deletions shown as 
strike through text:
 
Class 041: Provision of information in the field of recreational activities, namely, sedated 
exercise being (exercise while sedated)
 
Applicant’s services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those originally 
itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. 
Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting items to 
result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different services or add 
services not found or encompassed by those in the original application or as acceptably amended. SeeTMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the services sets the outer limit for any changes to the 
identification and is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. 
TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any acceptable changes to the services will further limit scope, 
and once services are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04. 
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on

The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191;

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
