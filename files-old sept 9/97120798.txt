NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SUMMARY OF ISSUES: 
Section 2(d) Refusal – Likelihood of Confusion 
•
Amendment to Identification of Goods Required 
•
 
 
1. SECTION 2(D) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 6335418. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached Registration. 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is determined on a case-
by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 
1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 
F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of record related to those 
factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant or of similar weight in 
every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) 
(quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 USPQ2d at 1747 
(quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1380 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 
24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) goes to the cumulative 
effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and differences in the 
marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Statement of Facts Specific to this Application:
 
Applicant's mark is BREEZE (standard characters) for “Surgical and medical instruments and 
apparatus, namely, orthopaedic splints; orthopaedic supports; orthopaedic bandages; orthopaedic 
hosiery; compression bandages; support bandages; medical compression garments, namely, 
compression stockings; compression tights; compression socks; support stockings; support tights; 
support socks; gloves for medical purposes” in International Class 010.
 
Registrant's mark is SKYBREEZE (standard characters) for “Medical examination gloves; Protective 
gloves for medical use; Surgical gloves; Nitrile gloves for medical use” in International Class 010.
 
Comparison of the Marks:  
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marksconfusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).  
 
Incorporating the entirety of one mark within another does not obviate the similarity between the 
compared marks, as in the present case, nor does it overcome a likelihood of confusion under Section 
2(d). See Wella Corp. v. Cal. Concept Corp., 558 F.2d 1019, 1022, 194 USPQ 419, 422 (C.C.P.A. 
1977) (holding CALIFORNIA CONCEPT and surfer design and CONCEPT confusingly similar); 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Jos. E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 526 F.2d 556, 557, 188 USPQ 105, 106 
(C.C.P.A. 1975) (holding BENGAL LANCER and design and BENGAL confusingly similar); Double 
Coin Holdings, Ltd. v. Tru Dev., 2019 USPQ2d 377409, at *6-7 (TTAB 2019) (holding ROAD 
WARRIOR and WARRIOR (stylized) confusingly similar); In re Mr. Recipe, LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1084, 
1090 (TTAB 2016) (holding JAWS DEVOUR YOUR HUNGER and JAWS confusingly similar); 
TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii).
 
In the present case, there is a likelihood of confusion because registrant's mark SKYBREEZE 
incorporates the entirety of applicant's mark BREEZE. The additional word in registrant's mark, SKY, 
does not give its mark a significantly different commercial impression from applicant's mark as it refers 
to a type of BREEZE. Thus, the marks are identical in part, which gives them a confusingly similar 
commercial impression. 
 
Because the overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods, but 
to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer. 
See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Therefore, any 
doubt regarding a likelihood of confusion determination is resolved in favor of the registrant. TMEP 
§1207.01(d)(i); see Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1265, 62 USPQ2d 
1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2002); In re Hyper Shoppes (Ohio), Inc., 837 F.2d 463, 464- 65, 6 USPQ2d 1025, 
1026 (Fed. Cir. 1988). For the reasons set forth above, the examining attorney has determined that the 
marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impressions such that individuals who 
encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties and thus confuse the 
source of the goods.
 
Relatedness of the Goods:
 
The goods are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, or travel in the 
same trade channels. See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369-71, 101 
USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1165, 
64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
The compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods] emanate from 
the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 
1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 
2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods stated in the applicationand registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 
F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 
1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the application uses broad wording to describe one of its goods as "gloves for medical 
purposes," which presumably encompasses all goods of the type described, including registrant’s more 
narrow "Medical examination gloves," "protective gloves for medical use," "surgical gloves," and 
"nitrile gloves for medical use." See, e.g., In re Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 
(TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, 
applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally identical, in part.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 
USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 
F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 
USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 
1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are related, in part.
 
After considering the similarity of the marks and relatedness of the goods, the examining attorney has 
determined that the applied-for mark is similar to the registered mark, and the goods are sufficiently 
related so that individuals would be likely to assume, upon encountering the goods under similar marks, 
that they originate from, are sponsored or authorized by, or are otherwise connected to the same source. 
Accordingly, the mark is refused registration under Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act. 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
2. AMENDMENT TO IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS REQUIRED
 
The identification of goods must be amended because it includes wording that is indefinite, as further 
explained below.  
 
Applicant used the following identification in its application:
 
International Class 010: Surgical and medical instruments and apparatus, namely, orthopaedic 
splints; orthopaedic supports; orthopaedic bandages; orthopaedic hosiery; compression bandages; 
support bandages; medical compression garments, namely, compression stockings; compression 
tights; compression socks; support stockings; support tights; support socks; gloves for medical 
purposes 
 
Where indicated below, the wording in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified 
because it does not make clear what the goods are. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01.  
 
The unacceptable descriptions in the identification are identified by the use of bracketed explanations 
that immediately follow such descriptions.  If the examining attorney could deduce the nature of thegoods or services from the incomplete or indefinite description, comments and suggestions on how to 
make the description acceptable are provided.  Applicant should note that any wording in bold, in 
italics, underlined and/or in ALL CAPS below offers guidance and/or shows the changes being 
proposed for the identification of goods and services. If there is wording in the applicant’s version of 
the identification of goods which should be removed, it will be shown with a line through it such as 
this: strikethrough. When making its amendments, applicant should enter them in standard font, not in 
ALL CAPS.     
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
International Class 10: 
 
Surgical and medical instruments and apparatus, namely, orthopaedic splints {acceptable 
wording is “orthopaedic splints”}  
 orthopaedic supports
 orthopaedic bandages
 orthopaedic hosiery
 compression bandages
 support bandages
 medical compression garments, namely, compression stockings
 compression tights
 compression socks  {acceptable wording is “Compression garments, namely, compression 
socks”}  
 support stockings {acceptable wording is “Medical hosiery, namely, support stockings”}
 support tights {acceptable wording is “Medical hosiery, namely, support tights”}
 support socks {acceptable wording is “Medical hosiery, namely, support socks”}
 gloves for medical purposes
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e). Additionally, for U.S. applications filed under Trademark Act 
Section 44(e), the scope of the identification for purposes of permissible amendments may not exceed 
the scope of the goods and/or services identified in the foreign registration.  37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
Marmark, Ltd. v. Nutrexpa, S.A., 12 USPQ2d 1843, 1845 (TTAB 1989) (citing In re Löwenbräu 
München, 175 USPQ 178, 181 (TTAB 1972)); TMEP §§1012, 1402.01(b).
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on 
responding.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal and requirement in this Office action. See TMEP §§705.02, 
709.06.The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191;

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
