Section 2(d) Refusal-Likelihood of Confusion
•
Entity Uncertain
•
 
 
SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL-LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 4935378. Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq. See the attached registration.
 
 
Applicant's mark is THE BREAKAWAY for Downloadable software in the nature of a mobile 
application for designing, providing, planning, tracking and managing athletic and fitness workouts, 
training and coaching plans; Downloadable software in the nature of a mobile application providing 
exercise demonstration and information
 
 
Registrant's mark is BREAKAWAY for Downloadable mobile applications for setting goals, 
identifying behaviors, providing coaching, tools and information which assist users in identifying, 
achieving and adhering to their personal and professional goals; Downloadable mobile applications for 
setting goals, identifying behaviors, providing coaching, tools and information which assist users in 
identifying, achieving and adhering to their personal and professional goals in the fields of self-
improvement, personal growth, personal development, wellness and well-being, happiness, improving 
relationships, improving personal finances, personal health, diet planning and weight loss, physical 
fitness and exercise, quitting smoking, quitting drinking alcohol, anger management, stress 
management, improving sleep, career growth, communication skills, personal effectiveness, time 
management, and productivity; Downloadable mobile applications for identifying, monitoring,

change and form healthy habits and lifestyle choices, for communicating with other individuals and/or 
social networking with respect to content and the decision-making process, for utilizing calculation 
tools for setting goals, monitoring progress, and tracking completion, and for displaying daily and 
historic data to users for motivational and logging purposes
 
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
 
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
 
In a likelihood of confusion determination, the marks in their entireties are compared for similarities in 
appearance, sound, connotation, and commercial impression. In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 
1323, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1748 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 
746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve 
Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 
2005)); In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 
1973); TMEP §1207.01(b)-(b)(v).
 
In the present case, applicant’s mark is THE BREAKAWAY and registrant’s mark is BREAKAWAY. 
These marks are virtually identical in appearance, sound, and meaning, “and have the potential to be 
used . . . in exactly the same manner.” In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), 
aff’d, 866 F.3d 1315, 123 USPQ2d 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2017). The only difference being the additional 
wording "THE" in applicant's mark. When comparing similar marks, the Trademark Trial and Appeal 
Board has found that inclusion of the term “the” at the beginning of one of the marks will generally not 
affect or otherwise diminish the overall similarity between the marks. See In re Thor Tech Inc., 90 
USPQ2d 1634, 1635 (TTAB 2009) (finding WAVE and THE WAVE “virtually identical” marks; 
“[t]he addition of the word ‘The’ at the beginning of the registered mark does not have any trademark 
significance.”); In re Narwood Prods. Inc., 223 USPQ 1034, 1034 (TTAB 1984) (finding THE MUSIC 
MAKERS and MUSIC-MAKERS “virtually identical” marks; the inclusion of the definite article “the” 
is “insignificant in determining likelihood of confusion”). Additionally, because they are 
virtually identical, these marks are likely to engender the same connotation and overall commercial 
impression when considered in connection with applicant’s and registrant’s respective goods. Id.
 
Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar.
 
 
Similarity of the Goods
 
 
The applicant's and registrant's goods are provided above.   The compared goods need not be identical 
or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. See On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 
F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 
54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i). They need only be “related in some 
manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to themistaken belief that [the goods and/or services] emanate from the same source.” Coach Servs., Inc. v. 
Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-
Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the registration use(s) broad wording to describe broad goods, which presumably 
encompasses all goods of the type described, including applicant’s more narrow goods.  See, e.g., In re 
Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 
115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are legally identical.  
See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, 
Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter 
IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay 
Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  
 
Accordingly, registrant's Downloadable mobile applications for setting goals, identifying behaviors, 
providing coaching, tools and information which assist users in identifying, achieving and adhering to 
their personal and professional goals; Downloadable mobile applications for setting goals, identifying 
behaviors, providing coaching, tools and information which assist users in identifying, achieving and 
adhering to their personal and professional goals in the fields of self-improvement, personal growth, 
personal development, wellness and well-being, happiness, improving relationships, improving 
personal finances, personal health, diet planning and weight loss, physical fitness and exercise, quitting 
smoking, quitting drinking alcohol, anger management, stress management, improving sleep, career 
growth, communication skills, personal effectiveness, time management, and productivity; 
Downloadable mobile applications for identifying, monitoring, tracking and measuring users' 
behaviors, cognitions and emotions, for monitoring, assisting and influencing an individual's decision-
making process, delivery of content, information and advice to change and form healthy habits and 
lifestyle choices, for communicating with other individuals and/or social networking with respect to 
content and the decision-making process, for utilizing calculation tools for setting goals, monitoring 
progress, and tracking completion, and for displaying daily and historic data to users for motivational 
and logging purposes         
could encompass applicant's Downloadable software in the nature of a mobile application for 
designing, providing, planning, tracking and managing athletic and fitness workouts, training and 
coaching plans; Downloadable software in the nature of a mobile application providing exercise 
demonstration and information.  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s goods are related.
 
 
In total, the marks are virtually identical, and the goods are related.  Therefore, consumers are likely be 
confused and mistakenly believe that the goods come from common source.  Accordingly, registrationis refused under Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.
 
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
 
If applicant responds to the refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
 
 
ENTITY UNCERTAIN
 
 
The designation “LTD” is included in applicant’s name; however, the legal entity is set forth as a 
“corporation.” Generally, “LTD” identifies a “limited liability company, or limited company” and not a 
corporation. Therefore, applicant must specify whether the legal entity is a limited liability company or 
limited company, or a corporation and amend the application accordingly. TMEP §803.03(h); see 37 
C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(2), (a)(3)(ii), 2.61(b).
 
If applicant is a limited liability company or limited company, applicant must amend the legal entity 
and provide the U.S. state under whose laws it is organized. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii); TMEP 
§803.03(h). If applicant is a corporation, applicant must provide the legal name of the corporation and 
U.S. state or foreign country of incorporation or organization. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii); TMEP 
§803.03(c).
 
If, in response to the above request, applicant provides information indicating that it is not the owner of 
the mark, registration will be refused because the application was void as filed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); 
TMEP §§803.06, 1201.02(b). An application must be filed by the party who owns or is entitled to use 
the mark as of the application filing date. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(d); TMEP §1201.02(b).
 
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action. See TMEP 
§§705.02, 709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.
