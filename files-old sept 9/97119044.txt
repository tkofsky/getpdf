System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office

Issue date:  August 27, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
NO CONFLICTING MARKSThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks

U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:  
 
Description of the Mark – Accurate But Incomplete
•
Representative Samples of Use Required
•
Information Required
•
 
Applicant must respond to the following requirement(s) set forth below.
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE MARK – ACCURATE BUT INCOMPLETE
 
Applicant must submit an amended description of the mark because the current one is incomplete and 
does not describe all the significant aspects of the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.37; see TMEP §§808.01, 
808.02. In addition, Applicant must delete from the description any text that does not reference things 
appearing in the mark, such as interpretation, assessment, or analysis of the mark elements, or 
indications of how the mark is or is not used or intended to be used. A description must accurately 
identify only the literal and design elements shown in the drawing. See 37 C.F.R. §2.37; TMEP 
§808.02. 
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate:
 
The mark consists of the stylized wording MOLARY below a design of two horizontally aligned 
adjacent circular bands having a crescent shape appearing inside along the upper right edge, with 
a partial display of a smaller circular band appearing between and connecting the two circular 
bands, the stylized wording MOLARY appears inside along the upper left band  of the left 
circular band, three sets of mirror image arched lines begin above the smaller band design and 
end above the larger circular bands, and a curved band appears below the design.
 
REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES OF USE REQUIRED
 
Applicant has applied for many different goods in International Class 9. If an identification is so broad 
that it encompasses a wide range of products and/or services, then an applicant must submit evidence 
that it actually uses the mark on the wide range of products and/or services to obtain registration. See In 
re Air Products & Chemicals, Inc., 192 USPQ 84, recon. denied 192 USPQ 157 (TTAB 1976); 37 CFR 
2.61(b); TMEP §§904.01(a) and 1402.03.
 
The specimen of record shows use of the mark in connection with protective covers and cases for tablet 
computers. However, the identification of goods includes other items. Applicant must submit a sample 
of use for each of the following goods:
 
earphones; monoculars; telescopes; meteorological instruments; radio sets; scuba masks; sound 
bars; spotting scopes 
 
These samples of use need not be supported by a declaration, but must have been in use in commerce 
for all goods as of the application filing date. Applicant should delete all identifications of goods that 
are not yet in use in commerce, or if Applicant is unable to provide sample specimens to support use ofthe mark on these items, then Applicant may amend the filing basis for those goods that were not in 
proper use as of the application filing date to an intent to use basis under Section 1(b). This option will 
later necessitate additional fees and filing requirements such as providing a specimen for these goods at 
a subsequent date. See the ITU basis webpage for more information about an amendment to allege use 
or statement of use.
 
Failure to comply with a requirement to furnish additional samples of specimens is grounds for refusing 
registration. In re Harley, 119 USPQ2d 1755, 1757-58 (TTAB 2016); TMEP §814. Merely stating that 
evidence is available on Applicant’s or a third party website or providing a hyperlink of such a website 
is an insufficient response and will not make the additional specimens of record. See In re Planalytics, 
Inc., 70 USPQ2d 1453, 1457-58 (TTAB 2004).
 
INFORMATION REQUIRED
 
To permit proper examination of the application, for each of the goods identified in the application, 
excluding the protective covers and cases for tablet computers in the specimen of use, Applicant must:
 
(1) Provide samples of consummated transactions (e.g., receipts, invoices) evidencing a presence 
in U.S. commerce;
 
OR
 
(2) If samples of consummated transactions are not available, then provide the location 
where/how these goods may be purchased/travel in U.S. commerce. Examples may include the 
URL address for online presence within the U.S., the names of brick-and-mortar stores in the 
U.S. where the goods may be seen/purchased, the name and type of intermediary employed to 
further the transaction in U.S. commerce.
 
This information is not readily available to the examining attorney, and is pertinent to examination of 
the application. Conclusory statements from the applicant or its attorney will not be sufficient to meet 
this requirement for information. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §814.  Failure to comply with a 
request for information is grounds for refusing registration. In re Harley, 119 USPQ2d 1755, 1757-58 
(TTAB 2016); TMEP §814. 
 
TRANSLATION NOTED
 
Applicant's statement that the mark has no English translation has been noted.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
