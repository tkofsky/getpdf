System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Mark is the Name of a Performing Artist 
•
Specimen Refusal
•
 
MARK IS THE NAME OF A PERFORMING ARTIST
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark, as used on the specimen of record, merely 
identifies the name of a featured performer(s) on a sound recording; it does not function as a trademark 
to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and to identify and distinguish them from others. Trademark 
Act Sections 1, 2, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1052, 1127; see In re Polar Music Int’l AB, 714 F.2d 
1567, 1572, 221 USPQ 315, 318 (Fed. Cir. 1983); In re Arnold, 105 USPQ2d 1953, 1957 (TTAB 
2013). Sound recordings include musical and other performances on electronic, magnetic, or vinyl 
media or as downloadable files. See TMEP §1202.09(a).
 
Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following:
 
(1)        Submitting evidence that (a) the name is used on a series of sound 
recordings, and (b) the performer controls the quality of the recordings and controls the 
use of the name, such that the name has come to represent an assurance of quality to the 
public. See In re Polar Music Int’l AB, 714 F.2d at 1572, 221 USPQ at 318; In re Arnold, 
105 USPQ2d at 1958; TMEP §1202.09(a)-(a)(ii), (a)(ii)(B).
 
Evidence of a series includes photographs or screenshots of at least two different CD 
covers, webpages showing at least two different downloadable recordings, or similar types 
of images for at least two different recorded works that show the name sought to be 
registered. TMEP §1202.09(a)(i); see In re Polar Music Int’l AB, 714 F.2d at 1572, 221 
USPQ at 318. This evidence must show the mark on goods that are actually being used 
with the goods sold in commerce.
 
Evidence of control. If the sound recordings are recorded directly under applicant’s 
control, applicant may submit the following statement as evidence of control, verified with 
an affidavit or signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The applicant produces the 
goods and controls their quality.” TMEP §1202.09(a)(ii)(B); see 37 C.F.R. §2.193(e)(1). 
Other evidence of control includes licensing contracts or similar documentation. TMEP 
§1202.09(a)(ii)(B); see In re Polar Music Int’l AB, 714 F.2d at 1568-72, 221 USPQ at 316-
18.
 
(2)        Submitting evidence that (a) the name is used on a series of sound 
recordings, and (b) the name is promoted and recognized by others as the source of the 
series of sound recordings. See In re Arnold, 105 USPQ2d at 1958; TMEP §1202.09(a)-
(a)(ii)(A).Evidence of a series includes the items referenced above in response option 
(1).
 
Evidence of promotion and recognition includes advertising that promotes the name as 
the source of the series, third-party reviews showing use of the name by others to refer to 
the series, and declarations from the sound recording industry, retailers, and purchasers 
showing recognition of the name as an indicator of the source of a series of recordings. 
TMEP §1202.09(a)(ii)(A); cf. In re First Draft, Inc., 76 USPQ2d 1183, 1191 (TTAB 
2005); In re Scholastic, Inc., 23 USPQ2d 1774, 1777-78 (TTAB 1992).
 
(3)        Amending the application to seek registration on the Supplemental 
Register. Trademark Act Section 23(c), 15 U.S.C. §1091(c); see 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§816, 1202.09(a).
 
If applicant cannot satisfy one of the above requirements, applicant may amend the application from a 
use in commerce basis under Trademark Act Section 1(a) to an intent to use basis under Section 1(b), 
and the refusal will be withdrawn. See TMEP §806.03(c). However, if applicant amends the basis to 
Section 1(b), registration will not be granted until applicant later amends the application back to use in 
commerce by filing an acceptable allegation of use along with satisfying one of the above requirements. 
See 15 U.S.C. §1051(c), (d); 37 C.F.R. §§2.76, 2.88; TMEP §1103. If the same specimen is submitted 
with an allegation of use, and applicant does not either provide the additional evidence described above 
or amend to the Supplemental Register, the same refusal will issue.
 
To amend to Section 1(b), applicant must submit the following statement, verified with an affidavit or 
signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “Applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in 
commerce and had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the filing date of the 
application.” 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(2); TMEP §806.01(b); see 15 U.S.C. §1051(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.35(b)(1), 2.193(e)(1).
DISCLAIMER REQUIRED
 
Applicant must disclaim the descriptive wording “SYMPHONY” in the mark because it is merely 
descriptive of an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s 
goods and/or services, and thus is an unregisterable component of the mark.  See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The word “SYMPHONY” appearing in the mark means "an instrumental passage in a vocal or choral 
composition. See the attached dictionary evidence. Given that applicant's services include musical 
recordings, the term "SYMPHONY" describes a feature of the recordings. 
 
A “disclaimer” is a statement in the application record that an applicant does not claim exclusive rights 
to an unregistrable component of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 979-
80, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213. A disclaimer does not physically remove the 
disclaimed matter from the mark or otherwise affect the appearance of the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. 
John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d at 979, 144 USPQ2d at 433; TMEP §1213. 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “SYMPHONY” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120220
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.

(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
