NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKSThe trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Specimen Not Acceptable
•
 
SPECIMEN NOT ACCEPTABLE
 
Specimen does not show direct association between mark and services. Registration is refused 
because the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and the services and fails to 
show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the identified services in International 
Class 44. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 
2.56(a), (b)(2); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(f)(ii), (g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for 
each international class of services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. 
§1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
When determining whether a mark is used in connection with the services in the application, a key 
consideration is the perception of the user. In re JobDiva, Inc., 843 F.3d 936, 942, 121 USPQ2d 1122, 
1126 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., 686 F.3d 1376, 1381-82, 103 
USPQ2d 1672, 1676 (Fed Cir. 2012)). A specimen must show the mark used in a way that would create 
in the minds of potential consumers a sufficient nexus or direct association between the mark and the 
services being offered. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2); In re Universal Oil Prods. Co., 476 F.2d 653, 655, 
177 USPQ2d 456, 457 (C.C.P.A. 1973); TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii).
 
To show a direct association, specimens consisting of advertising or promotional materials must (1) 
explicitly reference the services and (2) show the mark used to identify the services and their source. In 
re The Cardio Grp., LLC, 2019 USPQ2d 227232, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (quoting In re WAY Media, 
LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1697, 1698 (TTAB 2016)); TMEP §1301.04(f)(ii). Although the exact nature of the 
services does not need to be specified in the specimen, there must be something that creates in the mind 
of the purchaser an association between the mark and the services. In re Adair, 45 USPQ2d 1211, 1215 
(TTAB 1997) (quoting In re Johnson Controls Inc., 33 USPQ2d 1318, 1320 (TTAB 1994)). 
 
In the present case, the specimen does not show a direct association between the mark and services 
because the specimen only states that the services involve "The Path to Becoming Who You Were 
Always Meant to Be" with links to "About," "Shop," "Events," "My Learning," "Find a Practitioner," 
"Research," and "T&C's." Therefore, it is unclear if applicant is providing educational or health care 
services under the mark, and there is no indication that applicant is providing "therapy and treatment 
for overcoming fear, phobias, trauma, addiction, grief, feeling of loss, physical pain, and neuropathy 
through the use of sphere-shaped articles of manufacture having printed media at predetermined 
locations thereon, including chakra symbols" specifically.
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C).  Any webpage printout orscreenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the date it was accessed or 
printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, or in a verified 
statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); 
TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
RESPONSE GUIDELINES
 
For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal and/or requirement in this 
Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and evidence against the refusal, 
and may have other response options if specified above. For a requirement, applicant should set forth

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97120596
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
