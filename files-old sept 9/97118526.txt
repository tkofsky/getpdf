NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue datebelow or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 22, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.

Section 2(d) Refusal – Likelihood of Confusion
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark in 
U.S. Registration No. 5269196.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. §1052(d); see TMEP 
§§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registration(s).
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that so resembles a registered mark 
that it is likely a consumer would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the source of the goods 
and/or services of the applicant and registrant(s).  See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).  Determining likelihood of 
confusion is made on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de 
Nemours & Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973).  In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 
866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  However, “[n]ot all of the [du Pont] 
factors are relevant to every case, and only factors of significance to the particular mark need be 
considered.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1366, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 
1719 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting In re Mighty Leaf Tea, 601. F.3d 1342, 1346, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1259 
(Fed. Cir 2010)).  The USPTO may focus its analysis “on dispositive factors, such as similarity of the 
marks and relatedness of the goods [and/or services].”  In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); see TMEP §1207.01. 
 
The applicant’s mark is AROMA FREEDOM CLINIC for “personal coaching and therapy.”
 
The registrant’s mark is AROMA FREEDOM TECHNIQUE for “training in the field of self-help 
techniques.”
 
Similarity of Marks
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression.  Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v).  “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marksconfusingly similar.”  In re Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014) (citing In re 1st USA Realty 
Prof’ls, Inc., 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1586 (TTAB 2007)); In re White Swan Ltd., 8 USPQ2d 1534, 1535 
(TTAB 1988)); TMEP §1207.01(b).
 
The marks create an overall similar commercial impression because they share the same terms 
AROMA FREEDOM.  Marks may be confusingly similar in appearance where similar terms or phrases 
or similar parts of terms or phrases appear in the compared marks and create a similar overall 
commercial impression. See Crocker Nat’l Bank v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , 228 USPQ 
689, 690-91 (TTAB 1986), aff’d sub nom. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Wells Fargo Bank, 
Nat’l Ass’n , 811 F.2d 1490, 1495, 1 USPQ2d 1813, 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (finding COMMCASH and 
COMMUNICASH confusingly similar); In re Corning Glass Works, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) 
(finding CONFIRM and CONFIRMCELLS confusingly similar); In re Pellerin Milnor Corp., 221 
USPQ 558, 560 (TTAB 1983) (finding MILTRON and MILLTRONICS confusingly similar); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)(ii)-(iii).
 
The dominant element of the marks AROMA FREEDOM creates a confusingly similar commercial 
impression with the registered mark because a consumer would likely believe AROMA FREEDOM 
CLINIC and AROMA FREEDOM TECHNIQUE refer to the same source.
 
Although marks are compared in their entireties, one feature of a mark may be more significant or 
dominant in creating a commercial impression.  See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 
128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 
1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii).  Matter that is descriptive of or 
generic for a party’s goods and/or services is typically less significant or less dominant in relation to 
other wording in a mark.  See Anheuser-Busch, LLC v. Innvopak Sys. Pty Ltd., 115 USPQ2d 1816, 
1824-25 (TTAB 2015) (citing In re Chatam Int’l Inc., 380 F.3d 1340, 1342-43, 71 USPQ2d 1944, 1946 
(Fed. Cir. 2004)).
 
In the present case, as further explained in the disclaimer requirement below, the attached dictionary 
evidence shows that the wording CLINIC in the applied-for mark is generic for applicant’s services.  
Thus, this wording is less significant in terms of affecting the mark’s commercial impression, and 
renders the wording AROMA FREEDOM the more dominant element of the mark.  Likewise, the 
disclaimer statement in the registrant’s shows a disclaimer of the descriptive or generic wording 
TECHNIQUE, rendering the wording AROMA FREEDOM the more dominant element of the 
registered mark. 
 
Therefore, the marks are confusingly similar because applicant’s mark AROMA FREEDOM CLINIC 
creates an overall similar commercial impression with the registered mark AROMA FREEDOM 
TECHNIQUE.
 
Relatedness of Services
The goods and/or services are compared to determine whether they are similar, commercially related, 
or travel in the same trade channels.  See Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 
1369-71, 101 USPQ2d 1713, 1722-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 
F.3d 1156, 1165, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§1207.01, 1207.01(a)(vi).
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods and/or services stated in 
the application and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit 
Athletic Co., 903 F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In rei.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the registration uses broad wording to describe "training in the field of self-help 
techniques," which presumably encompasses all services of the type described, including applicant’s 
more narrow "personal coaching."  See attached online Macmillan dictionary.  See, e.g., In re Solid 
State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 115 
USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s services are legally identical.  
See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo Monopoly, 
Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 1981); Inter 
IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. Powerplay 
Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the services of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  
 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
other 
services, 
the 
attached 
internet 
evidence 
from 
T&T 
at https://therapyandtraining.ie/, 
Jodi 
Baglien 
Aromatherapy at 
https://www.jodibaglien.online/aromatherapy-core-program, and The Physical Therapy Zone at 
https://physicaltherapyzone.com/ establishes that companies like the applicant that provide "various 
therapy services" also provide "training services," like the registrant. This evidence shows that 
applicant’s and registrant’s services overlap and are commonly available from a single source. 
Moreover, this evidence indicates that the relevant consumers are likely accustomed to encountering 
"therapy and training services 
 emanating from the same source and offered under the same mark. Thus, applicant’s and registrant’s 
services are considered related for likelihood of confusion purposes.  See, e.g., In re Davey Prods. Pty 
Ltd., 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202-04 (TTAB 2009); In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp., 91 USPQ2d 1266, 
1268-69, 1271-72 (TTAB 2009).
 
Upon encountering highly similar marks and identical and otherwise closely related services, 
consumers would mistakenly believe that applicant’s services and registrant’s services emanate from a 
common source, and thus a likelihood of confusion as to source would result.  Therefore, applicant’s 
mark is not entitled to registration.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal – Merely Descriptive
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature of applicant’s services.  
Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services.  TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson 
LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 
1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r ofPatents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)). 
 
The applicant applied to register the mark AROMA FREEDOM CLINIC for “personal coaching and 
therapy.” 
 
The attached third-party websites at https://www.peghaust.com/aroma-freedom.html define AROMA 
FREEDOM as using "essential oils and focusing exercises to clear negative thought patterns that get in 
our way. It combines aromatherapy, energy medicine, neuroscience and the last 100 years of 
psychology into a simple 12- step process."  Moreover, the attached third party websites 
at https://theoilspotrva.com/aroma-freedom-technique/ and https://www.janellrardon.com/aroma-
freedom-technique/ clearly show that AROMA FREEDOM is commonly used by others to describe a 
technique used in training, coaching and therapy services.
  
In addition, the attached entry from the online Macmillan dictionary, the term CLINIC is defined as “a 
place where people go to receive a particular type of medical treatment or advice." 
 
Therefore, AROMA FREEDOM merely describes a feature and CLINIC generic wording of 
applicant’s services.
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods and/or services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not 
registrable.  In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re 
Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB (2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., Apollo 
Med. Extrusion Techs., Inc. v. Med. Extrusion Techs., Inc., 123 USPQ2d 1844, 1851 (TTAB 2017) 
(holding MEDICAL EXTRUSION TECHNOLOGIES merely descriptive of medical extrusion goods 
produced by employing medical extrusion technologies); In re Cannon Safe, Inc., 116 USPQ2d 1348, 
1351 (TTAB 2015) (holding SMART SERIES merely descriptive of metal gun safes); In re King Koil 
Licensing Co., 79 USPQ2d 1048, 1052 (TTAB 2006) (holding THE BREATHABLE MATTRESS 
merely descriptive of beds, mattresses, box springs, and pillows). 
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services is the combined mark 
registrable.  See In re Colonial Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In 
re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, AROMA FREEDOM CLINIC included generic wording and immediately describes a 
feature of applicant's services, i.e., providing a place where others go to receive aromatherapy and 
personal coaching services for mental and perhaps physical disorders and other conditions or otherwise 
known as AROMA FREEDOM CLINIC.  Therefore, the combination of terms does not create a unique 
or incongruous meaning.  
 
For the above reasons, the proposed mark AROMA FREEDOM CLINIC directly and immediately 
conveys information about applicant's services.  Accordingly, the proposed mark is merely descriptive, 
and registration is properly refused on the Principal Register under section 2(e)(1).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. 
 
Suggest Amendment to Supplemental RegisterThe applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register.  Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register.  See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816.  Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant 
from submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal(s).  TMEP §816.04.
 
Disclaimer of Generic Wording if Amending to Supplemental Register 
Applicant is advised that, if the application is amended to seek registration on the Principal Register 
under Trademark Act Section 2(f) or on the Supplemental Register, applicant will be required to 
disclaim “CLINIC” because such wording appears to be generic in the context of applicant’s goods 
and/or services. See 15 U.S.C. §1056(a); In re Wella Corp., 565 F.2d 143, 144, 196 USPQ 7, 8 
(C.C.P.A. 1977); In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 USPQ 766, 768 (TTAB 1986); TMEP 
§1213.03(b).
 
Applicant may submit a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “CLINIC” apart from the mark as shown.
 
TMEP §1213.08(a)(i).
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.
 
Request for Information--Descriptive 
 
Due to the descriptive nature of the applied-for mark, applicant must provide the following information 
and documentation regarding the goods and/or services and wording appearing in the mark:
 
(1)        Fact sheets, instruction manuals, brochures, advertisements and pertinent 
screenshots of applicant’s website as it relates to the goods and/or services in the 
application, including any materials using the terms in the applied-for mark. Merely stating 
that information about the goods and/or services is available on applicant’s website is 
insufficient to make the information of record.;
 
(2)        If these materials are unavailable, applicant should submit similar 
documentation for goods and services of the same type, explaining how its own product or 
services will differ. If the goods and/or services feature new technology and information 
regarding competing goods and/or services is not available, applicant must provide a 
detailed factual description of the goods and/or services. Factual information about the 
goods must make clear how they operate, salient features, and prospective customers and 
channels of trade. For services, the factual information must make clear what the services 
are and how they are rendered, salient features, and prospective customers and channels of 
trade. Conclusory statements will not satisfy this requirement.; and
 
(3)        Applicant must respond to the following questions: Do applicant’s services 
feature "aroma freedom" techniques? Do applicant’s competitors use "aroma freedom" to 
advertise similar services? Who is the typical consumer of applicant’s services? Where are 
applicant’s services typically provided?See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§814, 1402.01(e).
 
If applicant submits webpage evidence to satisfy this requirement, applicant must provide (1) an image 
of the webpage, (2) the date it was accessed or printed, and (3) the complete URL address. In re ADCO 
Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (TTAB 2020) (citing In re I-Coat Co., 126 USPQ2d 
1730, 1733 (TTAB 2018)); TMEP §710.01(b). Providing only a website address or hyperlink to the 
webpage is not sufficient to make the materials of record. In re ADCO Indus.-Techs., L.P., 2020 
USPQ2d 53786, at *2 (citing In re Olin Corp., 124 USPQ2d 1327, 1331 n.15 (TTAB 2017); In re HSB 
Solomon Assocs., LLC, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012); TBMP §1208.03); TMEP §814.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
Definite Identification of Services Requirement
 
Wording in the identification of services is (1) indefinite and must be clarified, (2) overbroad in that it 
encompasses goods/services in more than one international classification and/or (3) misclassified. See 
TMEP §1402.01. Please see suggested identification below for specific wording that requires 
clarification and/or reclassification.
 
Please note that bolded wording/punctuation indicates a suggested addition(s)/amendment(s) to 
applicant’s current identification to make it definite.   In addition, please note that the bracketed entries 
below require applicant to insert information.  Finally, please note that the suggested identification may 
include additional international classifications and, if applicant adopts these suggested identifications, 
applicant will need to comply with the requirements set forth in the multiple class requirements section 
below.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 41:  Personal coaching in the field of [specify field or subject matter]
 
Class 44:  [specify type, e.g., Aromatherapy] services 
 
Additions to Identification Not Permitted
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06.  Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended.  See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b).  The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification.  TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b).  Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted.  TMEP §1402.07(e).For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
To expedite prosecution of this trademark application, when amending the identification as required 
above, the Office strongly encourages the applicant to select pre-approved wording contained within 
this manual that accurately describes the goods and/or services therein.  Failure to do so may result in 
delay.
 
Section 1(a) Requirements for Combined Applications
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already 
paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  Specifically, the application identifies 
goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 2 classes; 
however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 class(es).  Applicant must either 
(a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) restrict the 
application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce for 
each international class.  See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class.  The current specimen is not 
acceptable for any international class.  See more information about specimens.
 
Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing the mark; (2) an 
actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-
sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display 
associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a picture or textual 
description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP 
§904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services 
and include:  (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or

C.F.R. §2.56(c).(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce on or in 
connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as early as the

Class Fees
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii).  For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.
 
Specimen Does Not Show Use in Specific Class  
 
Registration is refused because the specimen does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in 
commerce in connection with any of the services specified in International Classes 41 or 44.  
Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re 
Keep A Breast Found., 123 USPQ2d 1869, 1876-79 (TTAB 2017); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 
1301.04(d), (g)(i).  An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods and/or 
services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a); see In re Gulf Coast Nutritionals, Inc., 106 
USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2013). 
 
Specifically, the specimen is a website that shows applicant's mark thereon.  However, there is no clear 
indication of what the services are.  Thus, registration is refused because the mark is not shown in 
connection with the identified services in Classes 41 and/or 44. 
 
The applicant is required to submit a substitute specimen or amend to section 1(b).  See the 
requirements in detail below. 
 
Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual 
container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing 
the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A 
webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association 
with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering the 
goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include:  
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each applicable 
international class:
 
(1)  Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the 
goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use.  A “verified 
substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in 
a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20:  “The substitute (or 
new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at 
least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to 
allege use.”  The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.
 
(2)  Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes withdrawing 
an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required before 
publication.  This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements, 
including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 22, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97118526
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
