The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 22, 2022
INTRODUCTIONThe referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF OFFICE’S DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the Office’s database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
REFUSAL - SECTION 2(e)(1) - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE
•
REQUIREMENT - IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND/OR SERVICES
•
 
REFUSAL - SECTION 2(e)(1) - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes the central features of applicant’s 
goods and/or services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP 
§§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods and/or services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, 
Inc., 783 F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & 
Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re 
Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of 
P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
The proposed mark "SENSORS & SOFTWARE" for "Ground penetrating radar apparatus; 
instrumentation, namely, transducers, electronic circuitry, embedded and post data acquisition imaging 
software for inspection of concrete, asphalt and other building materials to determine the construction 
attributes, presence of flaws, location of embedded objects such as wires, conduits, rebar, post tension 
cables and similar items, and material layer thickness; signal processing technology comprising of 
hardware and software used in ground penetrating radar systems that allows dynamic adjustment of 
ground penetrating radar sensitivity applied in a wide range of subsurface sensing applications to 
enhance the measured data by providing dynamic reduction in ambient noise; mobile ground 
penetrating radar system for three-dimensional imaging, detection, location, and mapping of subsurface 
structures, consisting of non-metallic wheeled platform for manually transporting ground penetrating 
geophysical radar sensors, integrated odometer, power supply, control computer/display device and 
ancillary items over the ground surface; subsurface imaging instruments used for subsurface detection, 
water content determination, material property monitoring, rock mechanics and building structure 
monitoring and failure detection, cable failure detection, level detection, plus parts therefore, namely, 
transmitters, receivers, antennas, transducers, signal processors, signal displays, and signal processing 
software for data filtering and enhancing and controlling instrument operation; subsurface detecting, 
delineating and profiling systems and constituent parts thereof;, namely, transmitters, transducers, 
antennas, signal processors, signal recorders and displays and computer software; equipment used for 
determining snow depth, thickness, quality or water content, namely, associated software and 
computer; spatial positioning technology used for creating maps of snow depth, thickness, quality or 
water content, namely, transmitters, receivers, antennas, time reflectometry transducers, signal 
processors, computers, signal processing, display software and satellite global positioningsystems(GPS) inertial and doppler positioning instruments used for navigation; software used for 
displaying three-dimensional radar data, sonic acoustic electromagnetic data or any other type of data 
of similar format in chart form using color or grey level to indicate the third dimension, the data having 
been acquired by instruments used to map buried objects such as pipes and cables, soil layers, water 
depth, and audio signal frequency strengths versus time."
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
goods and/or services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not 
registrable. In re Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re 
Tower Tech, Inc., 64 USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS 
Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as 
hypodermic, aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 
(TTAB 2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner 
that is an integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services is the combined mark 
registrable. See In re Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial 
Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 
364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
goods and/or services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to 
the goods and/or services. Specifically, the attached evidence from The American Heritage 
Dictionary defines the singular version of the word "SENSORS" as "a device that receives and 
responds to a signal or stimulus." The same dictionary defines the word "SOFTWARE" as "the 
programs, routines, and symbolic languages that control the functioning of the hardware and direct its 
operation." The applicant's goods are all types of products that use a combination of sensors and 
software in order to make determinations relating to subject matters ranging from snow depth thickness 
to cable failures. The applicant's submitted specimen is a product manual which also shows that the 
goods are essentially defined by their combination of types of sensors and support software used for 
ground penetrating radar.
 
As such, registration is refused under Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act because the proposed mark 
merely describes that the central feature of applicant's goods and/or services is that they feature devices 
that receive and respond to a signal or stimulus as well as programs, routines, and symbolic languages 
that control the functioning of those devices and direct their operation.
 
Advisory - Mark appears to be Generic
 
In addition to being merely descriptive, the applied-for mark appears to be generic in connection with 
the identified goods and/or services. “A generic mark, being the ‘ultimate in descriptiveness,’ cannot 
acquire distinctiveness” and thus is not entitled to registration on either the Principal or Supplemental 
Register under any circumstances. In re La. Fish Fry Prods., Ltd., 797 F.3d 1332, 1336, 116 USPQ2d 
1262, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int’l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc., 782 F.2d 
987, 989, 228 USPQ 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); see TMEP §§1209.01(c) et seq., 1209.02(a). 
Therefore, the trademark examining attorney cannot recommend that applicant amend the application 
to proceed under Trademark Act Section 2(f) or on the Supplemental Register as possible responseoptions to this refusal. See TMEP §1209.01(c).
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
REQUIREMENT - IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS AND/OR SERVICES
 
Applicant must additionally clarify some of the wording in the identification of goods and/or services 
because it is indefinite.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.  This wording is 
indefinite because it does not make clear the exact nature of the goods and/or services. Applicant must 
amend the identification to specify the common commercial or generic name of the goods and/or 
services or otherwise identify the nature and purpose of the goods and/or service and the main using 
clear and succinct language. See TMEP §1402.01. The particular instances of indefinite wording are 
indicated below alongside examples of definite goods and/or services which could be substituted for the 
initial identification. For example, “transducers” could mean “electric transducers” or “electroacoustic 
transducers” and “hardware” could identify “computer hardware” or “microchips.” See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Please see the suggested amendments and possible substitutions below.
 
The various identifications for software in International Class 9 is indefinite and too broad and must be 
clarified to specify whether the format is downloadable, recorded, or online non-downloadable. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.03(d), 1402.11(a). Downloadable and recorded goods are in 
International Class 9, whereas providing their temporary, online non-downloadable use is a service in 
International Class 42. See TMEP §1402.03(d).
 
The identifications contain slashes and additional semicolons inserted into the middle of particular 
listings of goods. Applicant must correct the punctuation in the identification to clarify the individual 
items in the list of goods and/or services. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01(a). Proper 
punctuation in identifications is necessary to delineate explicitly each product or service within a list 
and to avoid ambiguity. Commas, semicolons, and apostrophes are the only punctuation that should be 
used in an identification of goods and/or services. TMEP §1402.01(a). An applicant should not use 
colons, periods, exclamation points, and question marks in an identification. Id. In addition, applicants 
should not use symbols in the identification such as asterisks (*), at symbols (@), or carets. Id. In 
general, commas should be used in an identification (1) to separate a series of related items identified 
within a particular category of goods or services, (2) before and after “namely,” and (3) between each 
item in a list of goods or services following “namely” (e.g., personal care products, namely, body 
lotion, bar soap, shampoo). Id. Semicolons generally should be used to separate a series of distinct 
categories of goods or services within an international class (e.g., personal care products, namely, body 
lotion; deodorizers for pets; glass cleaners). Id. The suggested amendments below resolve these 
issues using definite and unambiguous language.
 
Applicant should note that any wording in bold, in italics, underlined and/or in ALL CAPS below 
offers guidance and/or shows the changes being proposed for the identification of goods and/or 
services.  If there is wording in the applicant’s version of the identification of goods and/or services 
which should be removed, it will be shown with a line through it such as this: strikethrough.  When 
making its amendments, applicant should enter them in standard font, not in bold, in italics, underlined 
or in ALL CAPS.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate:Class 9: Ground penetrating radar apparatus; instrumentation, namely, transducers in the nature of ___ 
{indicate particular goods, e.g., electrical transducers, electroacoustic transducers}, electronic

See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.
 
An applicant may only amend an identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to 
add to or broaden the scope of the goods and/or services.  37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); see TMEP §§1402.06 et 
seq., 1402.07. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be reinserted.  See TMEP 
§1402.07(e).

TMEP §1402.04. 
 
Advisory – Multiple Class Application
 
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) 
already paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application 
identifies goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 2 
classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 class(es). Applicant 
must either (a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or 
(b) restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce 
for each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.
 
(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for class(es) 9; and applicant needs a specimen for class(es) 42. See more 
information about specimens.Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual 
goods bearing the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods 
bearing the mark; or (3) a point-of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with 
the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen 
submitted as a display associated with the goods must show the mark in association with a 
picture or textual description of the goods and include information necessary for ordering 
the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c).
