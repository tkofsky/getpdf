 Search Results
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
1.    Disclaimer Required
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “ALBERT TX", "EST. 1892" and "ICEHOUSE & 
DANCEHALL" because it is merely descriptive and primarily geographically descriptive of applicant’s 
goods.
 
"EST. 1892" and "DANCEHALL": The wording “EST. 1892” and "DANCEHALL" merely describes 
an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or 
services. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
 
“EST” is an abbreviation for “established,” which means “to cause (an institution, for example) to 
come into existence or begin operating; found; set up.” See attached definitions from the online 
American Heritage Dictionary. Together with the year “1892” this wording merely describes the year 
that the town of Albert, Texas was founded. See attached from https://www.alberttexas.com/  and 
https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/albert-tx showing that Martinsburg, Texas was renamed 
“Albert” in the year 1982.
 
An “ICEHOUSE” is a business that offers beer and sometimes food and drink. See attached fromhttps://www.liquor.com/articles/texas-icehouses/ (“A Lone Star icehouse is a centuries-old style of 
open-air, beer-hocking drinking establishment: part low-key convenience store, part bar, part respite 
from the blistering Southwestern sun”) and https://www.txfb-ins.com/blog/texas-living/texas-icehouse 
(“There is a small handful of classic Texas icehouses that remain, and they continue the tradition of 
providing a family-friendly gathering spot that offers hot food, cold drinks, and plenty of community”). 
This wording merely describes that applicant is a business that offers beer and community. See attached 
from applicant's website at https://www.alberttexas.com/ ("the tradition of community gatherings and 
dancing continues. We’re always happy to see familiar faces or make a new friend, so stop on by and 
enjoy a little taste of Texas tradition and a cold beer or cocktail while you’re at it"). 
 
The wording “DANCEHALL” means “a building or part of a building with facilities for dancing.” See 
attached definition from the online American Heritage Dictionary. This wording merely describes that 
the goods are provided by a business that is facility for dancing. See attached from applicant’s website 
at https://www.alberttexas.com/ (“The Albert Dance Hall was built in 1922 by Max Beckman, and 
provided the community a place for Saturday night dances and social gatherings”). 
 
Terms that describe the provider of a product or service may also be merely descriptive of the product 
and/or service. See In re Chamber of Com. of the U.S., 675 F.3d 1297, 1301, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1220 
(Fed. Cir. 2012) (affirming Board’s holding that NATIONAL CHAMBER was merely descriptive of 
online service providing directory information for local and state chambers of commerce and business 
and regulatory data analysis services to promote the interest of businessmen and businesswomen); In re 
Major League Umpires, 60 USPQ2d 1059, 1060 (TTAB 2001) (holding MAJOR LEAGUE UMPIRE 
merely descriptive of clothing, face masks, chest protectors and shin guards provided, designed, and 
used by major league umpires); TMEP §1209.03(q). 
 
"ALBERT TX" and design of map: In addition, the wording “ALBERT TX” is primarily geographically 
descriptive of the origin of applicant’s goods. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); In re Societe Generale des 
Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1451-52 (Fed. Cir. 1987); TMEP 
§§1210.01(a), 1210.06(a), 1213.03(a).
 
Applicant must also disclaim the design of the map of Texas because it is primarily geographically 
descriptive of the origin of applicant’s goods. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(2); In re Societe Generale des 
Eaux Minerales de Vittel S.A., 824 F.2d 957, 959, 3 USPQ2d 1450, 1451-52 (Fed. Cir. 1987); In re 
Joint-Stock Co. “Baik”, 80 USPQ2d 1305, 1309 (TTAB 2006); TMEP §§1210.01(a), 1213, 1213.03(a), 
(c).
 
An accurate design of geographically descriptive matter and the word or words which describe the 
design are legal equivalents; therefore, a design must be disclaimed the same as the primarily 
geographically descriptive wording See In re Can. Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., 86 F.2d 830, 832, 32 USPQ 
49, 50 (C.C.P.A. 1936); TMEP §1210.02(a).
 
The 
attached 
evidence 
from 
https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/albert-tx 
and 
http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasHillCountryTowns/Albert-Texas.htm shows that Albert, Texas as a 
town in Texas. "TX" is an abbreviation for "Texas". See attached definition from the American 
Heritage Dictionary online. Thus, ALBERT, TX is a generally known geographic place or location. See 
TMEP §§1210.02 et seq. Additionally, the design of the map of Texas is the legal equivalent of the 
geographic place Texas. TMEP §1210.02(a). The attached from https://www.tourtexas.com/texas-
maps/map-of-texas-cities and https://ftp.txdot.gov/pub/txdot-info/trv/maps/texas.pdf shows that the 
shape in the mark is an accurate representation of the shape of the state of Texas.The goods and/or services for which applicant seeks registration originate in this geographic place. See 
TMEP §1210.03. See attached from applicant's website at https://www.alberttexas.com/ listing 
applicant's address as "Albert-Stonewall, TX." Because the goods and/or services originate in this place 
or location, a public association of the goods and/or services with the place is presumed. See In re 
Hollywood Lawyers Online, 110 USPQ2d 1852, 1858 (TTAB 2014) (citing In re Spirits of New 
Merced, LLC, 85 USPQ2d 1614, 1621 (TTAB 2007)); TMEP §§1210.02(a), 1210.04.  
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format:
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use "ALBERT TX", "EST. 1892", "ICEHOUSE & 
DANCEHALL" and the design of the map of Texas apart from the mark as shown.
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage.  
  
2.         Specimen Lacks Required URL for International Class 41
 
Webpage specimen does not include required URL. Registration is refused in International Class 41 
because the specimen is not acceptable as a webpage specimen; it lacks the required URL. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a). Thus, it is unclear whether the specimen shows the 
applied-for mark in actual use in commerce. See Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.03(g), 904.07(a). An application based on 
Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in 
commerce for each international class of goods and services identified in the application or amendment 
to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
In 
this 
case, 
applicant 
provided 
the 
following 
as 
the 
URL 
for 
the 
specimen: 
"C:\Users\cnewberry\Desktop\Mid-2021 Bulk\Albert Music Calendar main logo.jpg." This is not a 
valid URL.  Because the webpage specimen lacks the associated URL, it is unacceptable to show use of 
the mark in commerce. TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Examples of specimens. Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a verified statement, in a signed affidavit or supported by a 
declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746, specifying the URL of the original 
webpage specimen and the date it was accessed or printed.(2)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen), including the 
URL and date accessed/printed directly on the specimen itself or in a separate statement, 
that (a) was in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application 
or prior to the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in 
commerce for the goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to 
allege use. Applicant must also submit the following statement made in a signed affidavit 
or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or new, or originally 
submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the 
filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.”
 
(3)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
3.          Applicant's Domicile Address Required 
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record identifies 
“c/o” or in “care of” another party’s address and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal 
place of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). 
The application lists the same address for the applicant and the attorney of record, and the attached 
from https://haylegal.com/contact-us/ shows that the address "611 W 5th St Suite 300 Austin TX 
78701" is the address of The Hay Legal Group, PLLC. A domicile address must identify either (1) the 
permanent legal place of residence, which is the place an individual applicant resides and intends to be 
the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal place of business, which is the juristic applicant’s 
headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  
See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a). All applications must include the applicant’s domicile 
address, which is required for a complete application. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.22(a)(1), 2.32(a)(2), 2.189.
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile 
as “c/o” or in “care of” another party’s address. In most cases, an address that is listed as “c/o” or in 
“care of” another party’s address is not acceptable as a domicile address because it does not identify the 
location of applicant’s headquarters where the entity’s senior executives or officers ordinarily direct 
and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1).
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide (1) documentation showing that the listed 
address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that applicant has no 
fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §601.01(b)-(b)(1).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden frompublic view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s domicile address. Applicant should provide the 
most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP 
§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.
 
To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.

A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application

(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m.

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
