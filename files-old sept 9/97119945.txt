action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:Name of Individual Inquiry
•
TEAS Plus Status Lost 
•
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
NAME OF INDIVIDUAL INQUIRY
 
Applicant must clarify whether the name "HANNAH.QI" in the mark identifies a particular living 
individual. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§813, 1206.03. In this case, the application neither 
specifies whether the name in the mark identifies a particular living individual nor includes a written 
consent. See TMEP §§813.01(a)-(b), 1206.04(a), 1206.05.
 
To register a mark that consists of or comprises the name of a particular living individual, including a 
first name, pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, an applicant must provide a written consent 
personally signed by the named individual. 15 U.S.C. §1052(c); TMEP §§813, 1206.04(a).
 
Accordingly, if the name in the mark does not identify a particular living individual, applicant 
must submit a statement to that effect (e.g., “The name shown in the mark does not identify a particular 
living individual.”).
 
However, if the name in the mark does identify a particular living individual, applicant must 
submit both of the following:
 
(1)        The following statement: “The name(s) shown in the mark identifies a 
living individual(s) whose consent(s) to register is made of record.” If the name is a 
pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, applicant must provide the following statement: 
“HANNAH.QI" identifies {specify actual name}, a living individual whose consent is of 
record.”
 
(2)        A written consent, personally signed by the named individual(s), as follows: 
“I, {specify name}, consent to the use and registration of my name, HANNAH.QI, as a 
trademark and/or service mark with the USPTO.”
 
For an overview of the requirements for names appearing in marks, and instructions on how to satisfy 
this requirement using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, see 
the Name/Portrait/Signature of Particular Living Individual in Mark webpage.
 
Applicant has a duty to respond directly and completely to this requirement for information. See In re 
Ocean Tech., Inc., 2019 USPQ2d 450686, at *2 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re AOP LLC, 107 USPQ2d 
1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013)); TMEP §814. Failure to comply with a requirement for information is an 
independent ground for refusing registration. In re SICPA Holding SA, 2021 USPQ2d 613, at *6 
(TTAB 2021) (citing In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); In re DTI 
P’ship LLP, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701-02 (TTAB 2003); TMEP §814).
 
TEAS PLUS STATUS LOSTProcessing fee required. Applicant must submit an additional processing fee of $100 per class because 
the application as originally filed did not meet the TEAS Plus application filing requirements. See 37 
C.F.R. §2.22(c); TMEP §§819.01-.01(q), 819.03. Specifically, applicant failed to meet the following 
requirement(s): a consent to register the mark from the person identified in the mark (or conversely, if 
appropriate, a statement that the name or portrait in the mark does not identify a living individual) was 
not provided;.
The additional processing fee is required regardless of whether applicant satisfies these application 
requirements.
 
Accordingly, the application will no longer be treated as TEAS Plus; it is now considered a TEAS 
Standard application. See 37 C.F.R. §2.22(c); TMEP §819.03.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 23, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119945
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be

USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
