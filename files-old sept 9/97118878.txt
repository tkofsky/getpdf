NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marksand has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below to enable further prosecution of the 
application. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
Disclaimer
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording “LABS” because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, quality, 
characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant’s goods and/or services.  See 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(e)(1); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 
USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The examining attorney relies on evidence in the form of the attached dictionary definition and/or web 
evidence. The evidence shows the wording means or refers to laboratories which means a place for 
scientific studies. In relation to the identified goods and services, the wording is merely descriptive 
because it designates a feature, quality or characteristic of the goods and services. Specifically, the 
identified goods and services are sufficiently broad to include or encompass or feature scientific 
studies. Thus, consumers who encounter the wording in relation to the goods and services would 
immediately understand that the wording refers to a salient aspect. The wording therefore must be 
disclaimed 
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “LABS” apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
Identification of the goods
 
Applicant is advised that the bolded wording is not acceptable and must be clarified because it either 
lacks sufficient specificity and/or is too broad thus might include goods in other classes and/or is mis-
classified. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §1402.01. Applicant must amend the identification to 
specify the common commercial or generic name of the goods. See TMEP §1402.01. If the goods have 
no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe the product, its main purpose, and its 
intended uses. See id. 
 
Further guidance for the amendment of the identification is embedded or provided below, as 
appropriate. Applicant may adopt any or all of the suggestions so long as they are accurate. If applicant 
does not adopt a suggestion, then applicant must amend the identification so that it is as specific as the 
suggestions or the language found in the U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services 
Manual. 
 
The current identification of the goods is:  
 
International Class 009: Scientific apparatus and instruments for use in testing wireless technology, 
microelectronics, biotechnology, microsystem techniques, semiconductor and nanotechnology; 
computer hardware and downloadable computer software for use in testing and measuring wirelesstechnology, 
microelectronics, 
biotechnology, 
microsystem 
techniques, 
semiconductor 
and 
nanotechnology; embedded software for use in testing and measuring wireless technology, 
microelectronics, biotechnology, microsystem techniques, semiconductor and nanotechnology
 
The wording "technology, biotechnology, microsystem techniques, nanotechnology" are fields 
and not goods for which the instruments are used to test.  Please specify the goods for which the 
scientific apparatus and instruments test.  Alternatively, applicant may name each of the testing 
apparatus by its generic name.
•
 
The "embedded software" must be further specified to identify the goods in which the software is 
embedded for proper classification.  That is due to the fact that embedded software is recorded 
software that is sold as a component of the finished goods in which it is embedded. Goods that 
are components sold as part of other finished goods are classified in the same class as the 
finished goods.  Therefore, embedded software in scientific testing apparatus would be in Class 9 
but embedded software in machines would be in Class 7.  The testing function in the current 
wording is not sufficient to specify the type of goods in which the software are embedded. 
•
 
Applicant's goods may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those originally 
itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. 
Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting items to 
result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods or add 
goods not found or encompassed by those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See 
TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification 
and is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP 
§§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any acceptable changes to the goods  will further limit scope, and once 
goods are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO's online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04. 
 
Identification of services 
 
The bolded portion(s) of the identification of services is unacceptable and must be clarified because  it 
either lacks sufficient specificity and/or is too broad and/or is mis-classified. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); 
TMEP §1402.01.  Generally, applicant must amend the identification to specify the common 
commercial or generic name of the services. See TMEP §1402.01. If the services have no common 
commercial or generic name, applicant must describe or explain the nature of the services using clear 
and succinct language. See id.  Some suggestions are embedded in the identification and are in italics. 
 
Applicant may adopt any or all of the suggestions so long as they are accurate. If applicant does not 
adopt a suggestion, then applicant must amend the identification so that it is as specific as the 
suggestions or the language found in the U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
The current identification of services is:International Class 042: Engineering services; development of precision systems and devices for 
wireless technology; consulting in the fields of wireless technology equipment; research services in the 
field of wireless technology, microsystem technology and nanotechnology; research services in the 
field of bio-sensorics and chemical sensorics; technical consulting for third parties concerning 
handling production plants and process equipment; providing temporary use of non-downloadable 
software for data processing; designing of computer software for others 
 
The "nanotechnology" consulting is not acceptable because nanotechnology can be applied in a 
variety of fields, e.g. scientific and medical.  As consulting services are classified in accordance 
with the subject matter of the consultation, the exact nature of the nanotechnology application 
must be specified for proper consideration. 
•
 
The "technical consulting for third parties concerning handling production plants and process 
equipment" likewise is too broad as technical consultation is also classified in accordance with 
subject matter.  In general, following are examples of acceptable identifications for consultation 
services: “providing business consultation” is classified in International Class 35, “providing 
financial consultation" is classified in International Class 36, “providing transportation 
consultation" is classified in International Class 39.  The wording "technical" is insufficient to 
narrow the services to Class 42;  and the wording "handling of production plants..." can involve 
business plans in Class 35, financial studies in Class 36 and scientific and technological upgrades 
of equipment in Class 42.  Applicant must amend to specify further.
•
 
Applicant's services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those originally 
itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. 
Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting items to 
result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods and/or 
services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original application or 
as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or services sets the 
outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of 
the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any acceptable changes to the 
goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services are deleted, they are not 
permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
Multiple class application requirements 
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that 
may be classified in more class(es) than those for which fee(s) has/have been paid.   Applicant 
must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or restrict the 
application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
Response guidelines
 
Applicant should include the following information on all correspondence with the Office: (1) the name 
and law office number of the trademark examining attorney, (2) the serial number and filing date of the 
application, (3) the date of issuance of this Office action, (4) applicant's name, address, telephone 
number and e-mail address (if applicable), and (5) the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.194(b)(1); TMEP §302.03(a).

will fail to register. See 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.65(a), 2.68(a); TMEP §§718.01, 718.02. 
Additionally, the USPTO will not refund the application filing fee, which is a required processing 
fee. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(1)(i)-(iv), 2.209(a); TMEP §405.04.
 
When an application has abandoned for failure to respond to an Office action, an applicant may timely 
file a petition to revive the application, which, if granted, would allow the application to return to active 
status. See 37 C.F.R. §2.66; TMEP §1714. The petition must be filed within two months of the date of 
issuance of the notice of abandonment and may be filed online via the Trademark Electronic

Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
