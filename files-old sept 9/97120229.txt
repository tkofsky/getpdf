Search Results - No Conflicting Marks Found 
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Section 2(e)(1) – Merely Descriptive Refusal 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature, characteristic, purpose, 
or function of applicant's services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP 
§§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant's services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, Inc., 783 F.3d 
872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 
F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); In re Steelbuilding.com, 415 F.3d 1293, 
1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1421 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of 
Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 543 (1920)).
 
Here, applicant has applied to register the mark AGILE OPERATIONAL RESILIENCY for use in 
connection with “Business management consulting and advisory services” in Class 35.   
 
First, the attached evidence from Lexico dictionary shows this wording means “a method of project 
management…that is characterized by the division of tasks into short phases of work,” and the attached 
evidence from Agile Business Consortium, Business 2 Community, McKinsey & Company, No Jitter,and Wikipedia shows that the word AGILE is commonly used in connection with similar business 
consultation services to mean that the consulting and advisory is in the field of the agile business 
method. Indeed, applicant itself describes its services as intended to "advise, develop, and deliver agile 
and adaptive programs to client to help their business navigate stresses . . ." See applicant's specimen of 
record. Thus, the wording merely describes applicant's services because the field or subject matter of 
applicant's consulting and advisory services is AGILE methods for business operations.
 
Moreover, the attached white paper from RSA shows that the wording OPERATIONAL RESILIENCY 
is "the ability of an organization to absorb changes and adapt 
in an evolving environment, so it can deliver its objectives, and survive and prosper". Moreover, the 
attached article from TechTarget further explains that "the goal behind operational resilience is to 
identify potential problems before they happen and come up with a plan to either mitigate the effects or 
to allow the organization to quickly recover". Further, the attached evidence from Castellan and PA 
Consulting shows that the wording OPERATIONAL RESILIENCE is commonly used in connection 
with similar business consulting services. Additionally, as shown by the attached evidence from 
applicant's website, applicant's services allow consumers to "enhance how [their] organizations manage 
operational risk". In other words, applicant is providing business and consulting services which 
promote OPERATIONAL RESILIENCY. As such, this wording is merely descriptive of a feature or 
purpose of applicant's services. 
 
Taken together, the collective wording AGILE OPERATIONAL RESILIENCY immediately conveys 
to consumers that applicant is providing services intended to enable its clients to swiftly adapt, respond 
to, and prepare for market changes, consumer demand, and risks.
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not registrable. In re 
Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re Tower Tech, Inc., 64 
USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. 
Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding 
SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such as hypodermic, 
aspiration, and injection needles and syringes); In re Fallon, 2020 USPQ2d 11249, at *12 (TTAB 
2020) (holding THERMAL MATRIX merely descriptive of a heat-responsive, malleable liner that is an 
integral component of an oral dental appliance).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services is the combined mark registrable. See In re 
Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019) (citing In re Colonial Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 
549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Shutts, 217 USPQ 363, 364-65 (TTAB 1983)); In 
re Positec Grp. Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant's 
services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services. 
Specifically, as explained above, each respective term and phrase, that is, AGILE and OPERATIONAL 
RESILIENCY, retains its ordinary meaning even once combined. 
 
Ultimately, when purchasers encounter applicant's services using the mark AGILE OPERATIONAL 
RESILIENCY, they will immediately understand the mark as indicating afeature, characteristic, 
purpose, or function of the services, and not an indication that applicant is the source of the services. 
Therefore, the mark is merely descriptive, and registration is refused pursuant to Section 2(e)(1) of theTrademark Act. 
 
Response Options to Refusals 
 
Although applicant's mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.
 
Advisory regarding Amendment to the Supplemental Register to Overcome Refusal 
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register. Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register. See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816. Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant 
from submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal(s). TMEP §816.04.
 
Although registration on the Supplemental Register does not afford all the benefits of registration on 
the Principal Register, it does provide the following advantages to the registrant:
 
(1)       Use of the registration symbol ® with the registered mark in connection with 
the designated goods and/or services, which provides public notice of the registration and 
potentially deters third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(2)       Inclusion of the registered mark in the USPTO’s database of registered and 
pending marks, which will (a) make it easier for third parties to find it in trademark search 
reports, (b) provide public notice of the registration, and thus (c) potentially deter third 
parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(3)       Use of the registration by a USPTO trademark examining attorney as a bar to 
registering confusingly similar marks in applications filed by third parties.
 
(4)       Use of the registration as a basis to bring suit for trademark infringement in 
federal court, which, although more costly than state court, means judges with more 
trademark experience, often faster adjudications, and the opportunity to seek an injunction, 
actual damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
(5)       Use of the registration as a filing basis for a trademark application for 
registration in certain foreign countries, in accordance with international treaties.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(d), 1091, 1094; J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair 
Competition §§19:33, 19:37 (rev. 4th ed. Supp. 2017).

encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for

•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
