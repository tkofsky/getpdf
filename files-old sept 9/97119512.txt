The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03. 
 
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS (Advisory)  
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
Applicant must respond to the  requirement(s) set forth below. 
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION WITH COLOR REQUIRED 
Although applicant submitted a drawing showing the mark in color with a color claim, applicant did not 
provide the required description that specifies where each color appears in the literal and design 
elements in the mark. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 2.52(b)(1); TMEP §807.07(a)-(a)(ii). Therefore, applicant 
must provide this description. See TMEP §807.07(a)(ii).
 
Generic color names must be used to describe the colors in the mark, e.g., red, yellow, blue.  TMEP 
§807.07(a)(i)-(ii). If black, white, and/or gray represent background, outlining, shading, and/or 
transparent areas and are not part of the mark, applicant must so specify in the description. See TMEP 
§807.07(d).
 
The following description is suggested, if accurate: “The mark consists of a white stylized letter "A" 
inside a red square with shades of red."  
 
 
 
IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION
Applicant has provided the followingidentificationand classification of goods and/ or services in its 
application:
 
International Class 041: Publishing of electronic publications; Providing a website featuring blogs and 
non-downloadable publications in the nature of articles and newsletters in the fields of news and 
current events; Providing an Internet website portal featuring news and current events; 
Publication of editorial content accessible via a global computer network 
 
The wording shown above in bolded text in the identification of services is unacceptable as indefinite 
because it is too broad and could include  services in other international classes,  specifically, 
"Providing an Internet website portal featuring news and current events" must be clarified.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03.   The subject matter of the information being provided 
determines classification of these services.  TMEP §1402.11(a)(ii).  For example, "Providing an 
Internet website portal featuring business news" is classified in International Class 35; "Providing anInternet website portal featuring financial news" is classified in International Class 36. Applicant must 
amend the identification to specify the common commercial or generic name of the services. See 
TMEP §1402.01. If the services have no common commercial or generic name, applicant must describe 
or explain the nature of the services using clear and succinct language. See id. 
 
Applicant may adopt the following identification, if accurate: 
 Publishing of electronic publications; Providing a website featuring blogs and non-downloadable 
publications in the nature of articles and newsletters in the fields of news and current events; 
Providing an Internet website portal featuring   news about  current events ; Publication of 
editorial content accessible via a global computer network   (INT. CLASS 41) 
•
 
  
Scope Advisory:   Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be 
expanded beyond those originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying 
language or deleting items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not 
substitute different goods and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by 
those in the original application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of 
the goods and/or services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally 
determined by the ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 
1402.07(a)-(b). Any acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once 
goods and/or services are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).  
 
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
 
 
MULTIPLE – CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS -- Requirements for a Combined 
Application under Trademark Act Section 1(a) 
The application references goods and/or services based on use in commerce in more than one 
international class; therefore, applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international 
class:
 
(1)        List the goods and/or services by their international class number in 
consecutive numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class (for example, 
International Class 3: perfume; International Class 18: cosmetic bags sold empty).
 
(2)        Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already 
paid (view the USPTO’s current fee schedule). Specifically, the application identifies 
goods and/or services based on use in commerce that are classified in at least 2 classes; 
however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 class(es). Applicant must either 
(a) submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or (b) restrict the 
application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
(3)        Submit verified dates of first use of the mark anywhere and in commerce for 
each international class. See more information about verified dates of use.(4)        Submit a specimen for each international class. The current specimen is 
acceptable for class(es) 41. Applicant must submit additional specimens if other classes 
are added to the application. See more information about specimens.
 
Examples of specimens.    Specimens for services must show a direct association between 
the mark and the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) 
a photograph of business signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the 
sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP 
§1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s 
URL and the date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form 
that submits the specimen, or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. 
§1746 in a later-filed response. See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
(5)        Submit a verified statement that “The specimen was in use in commerce on or 
in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the application at least as early 
as the filing date of the application.” See more information about verification.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).

Application webpage.
 
 
CLOSING 
To expedite prosecution of this application, if the mark descriptionand suggested identification is 
acceptable to applicant, then applicant may phone or e-mail the undersigned attorney to resolve the 
outstanding issues in this Office action by examiner’s amendment, instead of submitting a written 
response.  Although the USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions, communication 
by phone or email is permissible to agree to proposed amendments to the application that will 
immediately place the application in condition for publication, registration, or suspension. See 37

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 24, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119512
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
