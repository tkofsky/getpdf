NONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 26, 2022
 
This Office action responds to applicant's Amendment to Allege Use filed on 08/24/2022. 
 
Legal Counsel Suggested
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant isencouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for 
more information.  
 
In a previous first Office action dated 12/17/2021 and 07/08/2022 Final Office action, the trademark 
examining attorney refused registration of the applied-for mark based on the following: 
Broad/indefinite Identification of Goods.
 
The following is a SUMMARY OF ISSUES that applicant must address:
 
NEW ISSUE: Specimen is a Drawing of the Mark Only
•
Maintained and Continued: Broad/Indefinite Identification of Goods
•
 
Applicant must respond to all issues raised in this Office action and the previous 07/08/2022 Office 
action, within six (6) months of the date of issuance of this Office action. 37 C.F.R. §2.62(a); see 
TMEP §711.02. If applicant does not respond within this time limit, the application will be abandoned. 
37 C.F.R. §2.65(a).  
 
 
NEW ISSUE: Specimen is a Drawing of the Mark Only 
 
Registration is refused because the specimen is merely a photocopy of the drawing or a depiction of the 
applied-for mark and does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the goods 
and/or services in International Class(es) 017. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 
1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (c); In re Chica, 84 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (TTAB 2007); 
TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must 
include a specimen showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international 
class of goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. 
§1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for goods include a photograph of (1) the actual goods bearing 
the mark; (2) an actual container, packaging, tag or label for the goods bearing the mark; or (3) a point-
of-sale display showing the mark directly associated with the goods.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c); 
TMEP §904.03(a)-(m).  A webpage specimen submitted as a display associated with the goods must 
show the mark in association with a picture or textual description of the goods and include information 
necessary for ordering the goods.  TMEP §904.03(i); see 37 C.F.R. §2.56(b)(1), (c). 
 
Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and the services and include: 
(1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business signage or billboards, or 
(3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the services.  See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP §1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpage’s URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. §2.20 or 28 U.S.C. §1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. §2.56(c); TMEP §§904.03(i), 1301.04(a).Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
“verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following 
statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: 
“The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
the amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this 
statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing 
requirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
Maintained and Continued: Broad/Indefinite Identification of Goods
 
Applicant did not respond to this issue. 
 
The following amended wording in bold in the identification of goods must be clarified because it is 
too broad or indefinite and could include goods in other international classes.  See TMEP §§1402.01, 
1402.03. 
International Class 017: “The Future of Dust Collection is Now with Dustopper”
 
Applicant must specify the generic name for the type of goods used for dust collection, and not merely 
insert the name of the applied-for trademark and/or a slogan for the goods. An applicant should not use 
its own registered or unregistered mark in an identification of goods and/or services.  TMEP 
§1402.09.  Identifications of goods and/or services should generally be comprised of generic everyday 
wording for the goods and/or services, and exclude proprietary or potentially-proprietary wording, such 
as a registered term.  See TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.09.  The misspelling or phonetic equivalent of a 
registered mark should similarly be excluded, unless it is the common name of the goods and/or 
services.  TMEP §1402.09.
 
In the identification of goods, applicant must use the common commercial or generic names for the 
goods, be as complete and specific as possible, and avoid the use of indefinite words and phrases.  If 
applicant uses indefinite words such as “accessories,” “components,” “devices,” “equipment,” 
“materials,” “parts,” “systems” or “products,” such words must be followed by “namely,” followed by 
a list of the specific goods identified by their common commercial or generic names.  See TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.03(a).
Applicant may change this wording to following if accurate.International Class 007: “Dust separators for use with dust collecting vacuums”
See TMEP §1402.01.
 
If applicant adopts the suggested amendment of the identification of goods and/or services, then 
applicant must amend the classification to International Class 007.  See 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(7), 2.85; 
TMEP §§805, 1401.
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06.  Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended.  See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b).  The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification.  TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b).  Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted.  TMEP §1402.07(e).

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
