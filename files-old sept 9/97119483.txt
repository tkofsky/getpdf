Issue date:  August 26, 2022
 
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney.  
Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issues below.  15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
Section 2(d) Refusal - Likelihood of Confusion

Identification of Goods Requires Amendment
•
Multiple-Class Application Requirements

SECTION 2(d) REFUSAL – LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION
 
Registration of the applied-for mark is refused because of a likelihood of confusion with the mark 
SNOW BEAUTY CO. in U.S. Registration No. 5318570.  Trademark Act Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C. 
§1052(d); see TMEP §§1207.01 et seq.  See the attached registration.
 
Trademark Act Section 2(d) bars registration of an applied-for mark that is so similar to a registered 
mark that it is likely consumers would be confused, mistaken, or deceived as to the commercial source 
of the goods and/or services of the parties. See 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Likelihood of confusion is 
determined on a case-by-case basis by applying the factors set forth in In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (called the “du Pont factors”). In re 
i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 1315, 1322, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Any evidence of 
record related to those factors need be considered; however, “not all of the DuPont factors are relevant 
or of similar weight in every case.” In re Guild Mortg. Co., 912 F.3d 1376, 1379, 129 USPQ2d 1160, 
1162 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 
(Fed. Cir. 1997)).  
 
Although not all du Pont factors may be relevant, there are generally two key considerations in any 
likelihood of confusion analysis: (1) the similarities between the compared marks and (2) the 
relatedness of the compared goods and/or services. See In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d at 1322, 123 
USPQ2d at 1747 (quoting Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1164-65, 64 
USPQ2d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)); Federated Foods, Inc. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., 544 F.2d 
1098, 1103, 192 USPQ 24, 29 (C.C.P.A. 1976) (“The fundamental inquiry mandated by [Section] 2(d) 
goes to the cumulative effect of differences in the essential characteristics of the goods [or services] and 
differences in the marks.”); TMEP §1207.01.
 
Applicant has applied to register the mark UP TO SNOW GOOD in standard characters for use in 
connection with “Lipstick, lip gloss; lip creams; lip scrub; lip balm; highlighter; eyeshadow; eyeshadow 
primer; make-up setting spray” in International Class 3.
 
Registrant’s mark is SNOW BEAUTY CO. in standard characters for use in connection with 
“cosmetics” in International Class 3.
 
Similarity of the Marks
 
Marks are compared in their entireties for similarities in appearance, sound, connotation, and 
commercial impression. Stone Lion Capital Partners, LP v. Lion Capital LLP, 746 F.3d 1317, 1321, 
110 USPQ2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 
Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); TMEP 
§1207.01(b)-(b)(v). “Similarity in any one of these elements may be sufficient to find the marks 
confusingly similar.” In re Inn at St. John’s, LLC, 126 USPQ2d 1742, 1746 (TTAB 2018) (citing In re 
Davia, 110 USPQ2d 1810, 1812 (TTAB 2014)), aff’d per curiam, 777 F. App’x 516, 2019 BL 343921 
(Fed. Cir. 2019); TMEP §1207.01(b).Although there is no mechanical test to determine the dominant element of a mark, consumers would 
be more likely to perceive a distinctive term, even if suggestive, rather than a generic or descriptive 
term as the source-identifying feature of the mark. Tao Licensing, LLC v. Bender Consulting Ltd., 125 
USPQ2d 1043, 1059-60 (TTAB 2017) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 F.3d 1405, 1406-07, 41 
USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997); In re Binion, 93 USPQ2d 1531, 1534 (TTAB 2009)).
 
In this case, the distinctive term in Applicant's mark is the word SNOW due to the mark's play on 
words by replacing the word "no" in the phrase "up to no good" with the word SNOW. This play on 
words makes the term SNOW the distinctive element of the mark. 
 
In analyzing the registered mark, disclaimed matter that is descriptive of or generic for a party’s 
goods is typically less significant or less dominant when comparing marks. In re Detroit Athletic Co., 
903 F.3d 1297, 1305, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re Dixie Rests., Inc., 105 
F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); TMEP §1207.01(b)(viii), (c)(ii). Here, 
the words BEAUTY CO. are disclaimed in the registration rendering the word SNOW the dominant 
element of the registered mark. 
 
The dominant element of both marks is the identical word SNOW. These words are identical in 
appearance, sound, and meaning, “and have the potential to be used . . . in exactly the same manner.” In 
re i.am.symbolic, llc, 116 USPQ2d 1406, 1411 (TTAB 2015), aff’d, 866 F.3d 1315, 123 USPQ2d 1744 
(Fed. Cir. 2017). Additionally, because they are identical, these words are likely to engender the same 
connotation and overall commercial impression when considered in connection with Applicant’s and 
Registrant’s respective goods. Id.
 
Consumers familiar with Registrant's mark are likely to confuse Applicant's mark as a slogan for 
Registrant's goods. 
 
Because the marks look and sound similar and create the same commercial impression, the marks are 
considered confusingly similar for likelihood of confusion purposes.
 
Relatedness of the Goods
 
The compared goods need not be identical or even competitive to find a likelihood of confusion.  See 
On-line Careline Inc. v. Am. Online Inc., 229 F.3d 1080, 1086, 56 USPQ2d 1471, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 
2000); Recot, Inc. v. Becton, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000); TMEP 
§1207.01(a)(i).  They need only be “related in some manner and/or if the circumstances surrounding 
their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that [the goods] emanate from 
the same source.”  Coach Servs., Inc. v. Triumph Learning LLC, 668 F.3d 1356, 1369, 101 USPQ2d 
1713, 1722 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 7-Eleven Inc. v. Wechsler, 83 USPQ2d 1715, 1724 (TTAB 
2007)); TMEP §1207.01(a)(i).
 
Determining likelihood of confusion is based on the description of the goods stated in the application 
and registration at issue, not on extrinsic evidence of actual use.  See In re Detroit Athletic Co., 903 
F.3d 1297, 1307, 128 USPQ2d 1047, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 866 F.3d 
1315, 1325, 123 USPQ2d 1744, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).  
 
In this case, the registration uses broad wording to describe cosmetics, which presumably encompasses 
all goods of the type described, including Applicant’s more narrow lipstick, lip gloss, lip creams, lipscrub, lip balm, highlighter, eyeshadow, eyeshadow primer, and make-up setting spray .  See, e.g., In re 
Solid State Design Inc., 125 USPQ2d 1409, 1412-15 (TTAB 2018); Sw. Mgmt., Inc. v. Ocinomled, Ltd., 
115 USPQ2d 1007, 1025 (TTAB 2015).  Thus, Applicant’s and Registrant’s goods are legally 
identical.  See, e.g., In re i.am.symbolic, llc, 127 USPQ2d 1627, 1629 (TTAB 2018) (citing Tuxedo 
Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 648 F.2d 1335, 1336, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (C.C.P.A. 
1981); Inter IKEA Sys. B.V. v. Akea, LLC, 110 USPQ2d 1734, 1745 (TTAB 2014); Baseball Am. Inc. v. 
Powerplay Sports Ltd., 71 USPQ2d 1844, 1847 n.9 (TTAB 2004)).
 
Additionally, the goods of the parties have no restrictions as to nature, type, channels of trade, or 
classes of purchasers and are “presumed to travel in the same channels of trade to the same class of 
purchasers.”  In re Viterra Inc., 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(quoting Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc., 281 F.3d 1261, 1268, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 
(Fed. Cir. 2002)).  Thus, Applicant’s and Registrant’s goods are also related.
 
Because the marks are similar and the goods are related and legally identical, there is a likelihood of 
confusion as to the source of Applicant’s goods. Therefore, Applicant’s mark is not entitled to 
registration pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act.
 
Although Applicant’s mark has been refused registration, Applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.  However, if Applicant responds to the 
refusal, Applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below. 
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS REQUIRES AMENDMENT
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “highlighter” in the identification of goods in International Class3 
because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP §§1402.01, 1402.03. This 
wording is indefinite because it does not make clear what the goods are. Further, this wording could 
identify goods in more than one international class. For example, "highlighter make-up" are in 
International Class 3 and "highlighter pens" are in International Class 16.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 3: Lipstick, lip gloss; lip creams; lip scrub; lip balm; highlighter make-up; eyeshadow; 
eyeshadow primer; make-up setting spray 
 
Class 16: highlighter pens 
 
NOTE:  Applicant is not required to add the additional class, but must comply with the multiple-class 
application requirements below. The above wording in bold is suggested wording. 
 
Applicant’s goods may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those originally 
itemized in the application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06.  
Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting items to 
result in a more specific identification; however, Applicant may not substitute different goods or add 
goods not found or encompassed by those in the original application or as acceptably amended.  See 
TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b).  The scope of the goods sets the outer limit for any changes to the 
identification and is generally determined by the ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification.  
TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b).  Any acceptable changes to the goods will further limit scope, 
and once goods are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted.  TMEP §1402.07(e).For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
 
The application identifies goods that are classified in at least two (2) classes; however, Applicant 
submitted a fee sufficient for only one (1) class. In a multiple-class application, a fee for each class is 
required. 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a)(2), (b)(2); TMEP §§810.01, 1403.01. For more information about adding 
classes to an application, see the Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
Therefore, Applicant must either (1) restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the 
fees already paid, or (2) submit the fees for each additional class.
 
The fee for adding classes to a TEAS Standard application is $350 per class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§2.6(a)(1)(iii). For more information about adding classes to an application, see the Multiple-class 
Application webpage.
 
The Application identifies goods in more than one international class; therefore, Applicant must satisfy 
all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act Section 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee already paid (view 
the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods that are classified in at least 
two (2) classes; however, Applicant submitted a fee sufficient for only one (1) class.  Applicant 
must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the submitted fees or restrict the 
application to the number of classes covered by the fees already paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
