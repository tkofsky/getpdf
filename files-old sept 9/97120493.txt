United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) 
Office Action (Official Letter) About Applicant’s Trademark Application
 
U.S. Application Serial No. 97120493
Mark:  BRAZILIAN BEAUTIFICATION
Correspondence Address:  
ALYCE ZAWACKI 
ALYCE ZAWACKI LAW, PLLC 
PO BOX 41421 
AUSTIN TX 78704 UNITED STATES
Applicant:  DE CASTRO ROCHA WITHERSPOON, ANA CAROLINA
Reference/Docket No. N/A
Correspondence Email Address:  alyce@attorneyforcreatives.comNONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 23, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
 
Registration Refused - Section 2(e)(1) Merely Descriptive
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes the subject matter of the 
applicant’s services.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP §§1209.01(b), 
1209.03 et seq.
 
The applied-for mark is "BRAZILIAN BEAUTIFICATION" in standard characters for "Education 
services, namely, providing live and on-line courses in the field of surgical and non-surgical 
cosmetic procedures; Education services, namely, providing non-downloadable webinars in the 
field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; Education services, namely, providing 
panel discussions in the field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; Educational 
services, namely, providing educational speakers in the field of surgical and non-surgical 
cosmetic procedures; Educational services, namely, providing continuing professional education 
courses in the field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; Educational services, 
namely, developing, arranging, and conducting educational conferences and programs and 
providing courses of instruction in the field of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures; 
Educational services, namely, conducting informal on-line programs in the fields of surgical and 
non-surgical cosmetic procedures, and printable materials distributed therewith; Providing a 
web site that features informal instruction on surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures" in 
International Class 41.
 
A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, 
purpose, or use of an applicant’s services. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., In re TriVita, Inc., 783 
F.3d 872, 874, 114 USPQ2d 1574, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 2015).
 
The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s 
services, not in the abstract. DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247,1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b). “Whether consumers could guess 
what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the test.” In re Am. 
Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985).
 
In the present case, the applicant's mark is merely descriptive of its services. The terms "BRAZILIAN" 
and "BEAUTIFICATION" are defined as relating to Brazil and the action or process of improving the 
appearance of a person, respectively ("Exhibit A"). In the context of the applicant's services, this 
describes the subject matter thereof, namely, the applicant is providing training and education relating 
to processes and techniques from Brazil that are designed to improve the appearance of a person. The 
descriptive nature of the mark is demonstrated by the attached evidence from providers of cosmetic 
surgery services, which use the terms "BRAZILIAN" and "BEAUTIFICATION" to identify cosmetic 
procedures, such as lifts, that were designed and popularized in Brazil to improve the appearance of 
one's body ("Exhibit B"). As the applicant does not limit the nature of the cosmetic procedures for 
which it provides educational training, it is presumed to encompass those emanating from Brazil.
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not registrable. In re 
Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., 
DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1255, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1758 
(Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding SNAP SIMPLY SAFER merely descriptive for various medical devices, such 
as hypodermic, aspiration, and injection needles and syringes).
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services is the combined mark registrable. See In re 
Omniome, Inc., 2020 USPQ2d 3222, at *4 (TTAB 2019).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services. 
Specifically, whether viewed individually or as a composite result, the terms "BRAZILIAN" and 
"BEAUTIFICATION" indicate that the applicant's cosmetic surgery training services pertain to 
techniques and procedures emanating from Brazil that are intended to improve one's appearance.  
 
Therefore, the applied-for mark is merely descriptive of the applicant’s services and registration is 
refused under Section 2(e)(1). 
 
Advisory: Supplemental Register
Although an amendment to the Supplemental Register would be an appropriate response to this 
refusal(s) in an application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) or 44, such a response is not 
appropriate in the present case. The instant application was filed under Section 1(b) and is not eligible 
for registration on the Supplemental Register until an acceptable amendment to allege use meeting the 
requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.76 has been timely filed. 37 C.F.R. §2.47(d); TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03.
 
If applicant files an acceptable allegation of use and also amends to the Supplemental Register, the 
application effective filing date will be the date applicant met the minimum filing requirements under 
37 C.F.R. §2.76(c) for an amendment to allege use. TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b). 
In addition, the undersigned trademark examining attorney will conduct a new search of the USPTO 
records for conflicting marks based on the later application filing date. TMEP §§206.01, 1102.03.
 
Although registration on the Supplemental Register does not afford all the benefits of registration onthe Principal Register, it does provide the following advantages to the registrant:
 
(1)       Use of the registration symbol ® with the registered mark in connection 
with the designated goods and/or services, which provides public notice of the 
registration and potentially deters third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(2)       Inclusion of the registered mark in the USPTO’s database of registered and 
pending marks, which will (a) make it easier for third parties to find it in trademark 
search reports, (b) provide public notice of the registration, and thus (c) potentially deter 
third parties from using confusingly similar marks.
 
(3)       Use of the registration by a USPTO trademark examining attorney as a bar 
to registering confusingly similar marks in applications filed by third parties.
 
(4)       Use of the registration as a basis to bring suit for trademark infringement in 
federal court, which, although more costly than state court, means judges with more 
trademark experience, often faster adjudications, and the opportunity to seek an 
injunction, actual damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
(5)       Use of the registration as a filing basis for a trademark application for 
registration in certain foreign countries, in accordance with international treaties.
 
See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(d), 1091, 1094; J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair 
Competition §§19:33, 19:37 (rev. 4th ed. Supp. 2017).
 
The applicant is advised that if it files an amendment to allege use and amends the application to the 
Supplemental Register, it may delete the disclaimer for "BEAUTIFICATION" as the term is not 
generic for the services at issue.
 
Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
