Search ResultsThe trademark examining attorney has searched the Office’s database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d).  
TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).
 
Definite Identification of Goods Requirement
 
Wording in the identification of goods is (1) indefinite and must be clarified, (2) overbroad in that it 
encompasses goods/services in more than one international classification and/or (3) misclassified. See 
TMEP §1402.01. Please see suggested identification below for specific wording that requires 
clarification and/or reclassification.  Please note that bolded wording/punctuation indicates a suggested 
addition(s)/amendment(s) to applicant’s current identification to make it definite.   In addition, please 
note that the bracketed entries below require applicant to insert information. 
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 07:  Power tools, namely, lawn and garden tool in the nature of [specify, e.g., cultivators, 
edgers]; Power tool parts, namely, outdoor power tool parts in the nature of [specify, e.g., chippers, 
shredders]
 
Additions to Identification Not Permitted
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06.  Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended.  See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b).  The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification.  TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b).  Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted.  TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual.  See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
To expedite prosecution of this trademark application, when amending the identification as required 
above, the Office strongly encourages the applicant to select pre-approved wording contained within 
this manual that accurately describes the goods and/or services therein.  Failure to do so may result in 
delay.

Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO

•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
