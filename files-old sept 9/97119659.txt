DECLARATION: The signatory being warned that willful false statements and the like are punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both,
under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1001, and that such willful false statements and the like may jeopardize the validity of the application or submission orany registration resulting therefrom, declares that, if the applicant submitted the application or allegation of use (AOU) unsigned, all
statements in the application or AOU and this submission based on the signatory's own knowledge are true, and all statements in the
application or AOU and this submission made on information and belief are believed to be true.

ยง1051(a) or AOU under 15 U.S.C. ยง1051(c), the signatory additionally believes that: the applicant is the owner of the mark sought to be
registered; the mark is in use in commerce and was in use in commerce as of the filing date of the application or AOU on or in connection with
the goods/services/collective membership organization in the application or AOU; the original specimen(s), if applicable, shows the mark in use
in commerce as of the filing date of the application or AOU on or in connection with the goods/services/collective membership organization in

action.  
Issue date:  August 25, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. ยง1062(b); 37 C.F.R. ยงยง2.62(a),

Summary of Issues: 
Specimen Refusal
โข
Disclaimer Required
โข
 
Specimen Refusal 
 
Specimen is merely a drawing or depiction of the mark. Registration is refused because specimen of 
record one is merely a depiction of the applied-for mark, and specimen of record two does not show the 
applied-for mark at all, and does not show the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce with the 
services in International Class 43. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. ยงยง1051, 1127; 37 
C.F.R. ยงยง2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a), (c); In re Chica, 84 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (TTAB 2007); TMEP ยงยง904, 
904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen 
showing the applied-for mark as actually used in commerce for each international class of goods and/or 
services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. ยง1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. 
ยงยง2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP ยงยง904, 904.07(a).
 
Examples of specimens.  Specimens for services must show a direct association between the mark and 
the services and include: (1) copies of advertising and marketing material, (2) a photograph of business 
signage or billboards, or (3) materials showing the mark in the sale, rendering, or advertising of the 
services.  See 37 C.F.R. ยง2.56(b)(2), (c); TMEP ยง1301.04(a), (h)(iv)(C). 
 
Any webpage printout or screenshot submitted as a specimen must include the webpageโs URL and the 
date it was accessed or printed on the specimen itself, within the TEAS form that submits the specimen, 
or in a verified statement under 37 C.F.R. ยง2.20 or 28 U.S.C. ยง1746 in a later-filed response.  See 37 
C.F.R. ยง2.56(c); TMEP ยงยง904.03(i), 1301.04(a).
 
Response options. Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each 
applicable international class:
 
(1)        Submit a different specimen (a verified โsubstituteโ specimen) that (a) was 
in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to 
the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce 
for the goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A 
โverified substitute specimenโ is a specimen that is accompanied by the following 
statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. ยง2.20: 
โThe substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in 
use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of 
the amendment to allege use.โ The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this 
statement.
 
(2)        Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b) (which includes 
withdrawing an amendment to allege use, if one was filed), as no specimen is required 
before publication. This option will later necessitate an additional fee and filingrequirements, including a specimen.
 
For an overview of the response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy these 
options using the online Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the Specimen 
webpage.
 
How to submit a verified specimen.
 
After opening the appropriate TEAS response form, answer โYesโ to form wizard question #2, click 
โContinue,โ and provide the following for each relevant class for which a specimen is being 
submitted:
 
(1)        Under the heading โClassification and Listing of Goods/Services/Collective 
Membership Organization,โ check the box next to the following statement: โCheck here to 
modify the current classification number; listing of goods/services/the nature of the collective 
membership organization; dates of use; and/or filing basis; or to submit a substitute specimen, a 
foreign registration certificate, or proof of renewal of a foreign registration.  If not checked, the 
changes will be ignored.โ;
 
(2)        Attach specimen under โSpecimen Fileโ (attachment may not exceed 5 
megabytes);
 
(3)        Describe in the box below that location what the attached specimen consists of;
 
(4)        Check the box below the specimen description next to the following statement (to 
ensure that the declaration language is inserted into the form): โThe substitute (or new, or 
originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as 
the filing date of the applicationโ [for an application based on Section 1(a), Use in Commerce] 
OR โThe substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use 
in commerce prior either to the filing of the Amendment to Allege Use or expiration of the filing 
deadline for filing a Statement of Useโ [for an application based on Section 1(b) Intent-to-Use].; 
and
 
(5)        Follow the instructions within the form for signing. The form will require two 
signatures: one in the โDeclaration Signatureโ section and one in the โResponse Signatureโ 
section.
 
Although applicantโs mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal, applicant must also respond to the requirement set forth below.
 
Disclaimer Required 
 
Applicant must disclaim the wording โHOUSEโ because it is merely descriptive of a quality, 
characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicantโs services.  See 15 U.S.C. ยง1052(e)(1); 
DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 
(Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP ยงยง1213, 1213.03(a). 
 
The attached evidence shows this wording is commonly used in connection with similar goods and/orservices to mean "a structure serving as a dwelling for one or more persons".  See attached Internet 
dictionary evidence.  Thus, the wording merely describes applicantโs services because it immediately 
refers to the fact that the applicant is providing a "HOUSE" for those who need one for the reasons 
described in the applicant's identification of services.
 
Applicant may respond to this issue by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: 
 
No claim is made to the exclusive right to use โHOUSEโ apart from the mark as shown. 
 
For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to provide one using the Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS), see the Disclaimer webpage. 
 
Response Guidelines 
 
For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal and requirement in this 
Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and evidence against the refusal, 
and may have other response options if specified above. For a requirement, applicant should set forth 
the changes or statements. Please see โResponding to Office Actionsโ and the informational video 
โResponse to Office Actionโ for more information and tips on responding.
 
Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines of the trademark application process, applicant is 
encouraged to hire a private attorney who specializes in trademark matters to assist in this process. The 
assigned trademark examining attorney can provide only limited assistance explaining the content of an 
Office action and the application process. USPTO staff cannot provide legal advice or statements about 
an applicantโs legal rights. TMEP ยงยง705.02, 709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for 
more information.
 
Please call or email the assigned trademark examining attorney with questions about this Office action. 
Although an examining attorney cannot provide legal advice, the examining attorney can provide 
additional explanation about the refusal and requirement in this Office action. See TMEP ยงยง705.02, 
709.06.
 
The USPTO does not accept emails as responses to Office actions; however, emails can be used for 
informal communications and are included in the application record. See 37 C.F.R. ยงยง2.62(c), 2.191; 
TMEP ยงยง304.01-.02, 709.04-.05.

USPTO OFFICIAL NOTICE
Office Action (Official Letter) has issued  
on August 25, 2022 for  
U.S. Trademark Application Serial No.  97119659
A USPTO examining attorney has reviewed your trademark application and issued an Office 
action.  You must respond to this Office action in order to avoid your application 
abandoning.  Follow the steps below.
(1)  Read the Office action. This email is NOT the Office action.
(2)  Respond to the Office action by the deadline using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS). Your response must be received by the USPTO on or before 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time of the last day of the response period. Otherwise, your application will be 
abandoned. See the Office action itself regarding how to respond.
(3)  Direct general questions about using USPTO electronic forms, the USPTO website, the 
application process, the status of your application, and whether there are outstanding deadlines 
to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC).
After reading the Office action, address any question(s) regarding the specific content to the 
USPTO examining attorney identified in the Office action.
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Check the status of your application periodically in the Trademark Status & 
Document Retrieval (TSDR) database to avoid missing critical deadlines.
โข
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
โข
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain โ@uspto.gov.โ Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
โDocumentsโ tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
โขHiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
