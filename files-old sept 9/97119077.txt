SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Identification of Goods
•
Multiple-Class Application Requirements
•
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS 
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “music” in the identification of goods and/or services in 
International Class 16 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make clear what the goods and/or 
services are. Further, this wording could identify goods and/or services in more than one international 
class. For example, downloadable music files are in International Class 9 and music production services 
are in International Class 41.
 
Applicant must clarify the wording “books” and "posters" in the identification of goods and/or services 
in International Class(es) 16 because it is indefinite and too broad. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§§1402.01, 1402.03. This wording is indefinite because it does not make clear what the goods are. 
Further, this wording could identify goods and/or services in more than one international class. For 
example, printed books and posters are in International Class 16 and downloadable books and 
posters are in International Class 9.
 
Applicant has classified “t-shirts and pants” in International Class 16; however, the proper 
classification is International Class 25. Therefore, applicant may respond by (1) adding International 
Class 25 to the application and reclassifying these goods and/or services in the proper international 
class, (2) deleting “shirts and pants” from the application, or (3) deleting the remainder of the items in 
the identification and reclassifying the specified goods and/or services in the proper international class. 
See 37 C.F.R. §§2.86(a), 6.1; TMEP §§1403.02 et seq. If applicant adds one or more international 
classes to the application, applicant must comply with the multiple-class requirements specified in this 
Office action.
 
Additionally, has classified “plush toys” in International Class 16; however, the proper classification is 
International Class 28. Therefore, applicant may respond by (1) adding International Class 28 to the 
application and reclassifying these goods and/or services in the proper international class, (2) deleting 
“plush toys” from the application, or (3) deleting the remainder of the items in the identification and 
reclassifying the specified goods and/or services in the proper international class. See 37 C.F.R. 
§§2.86(a), 6.1; TMEP §§1403.02 et seq. If applicant adds one or more international classes to the 
application, applicant must comply with the multiple-class requirements specified in this Office action.
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 9: downloadable music files
 
Class 16: printed posters; series of printed fiction books
 
Class 25: t-shirts, pantsClass 28: plush toys
 
Class 41: music production services
 
Applicant may amend the identification to clarify or limit the goods and/or services, but not to broaden 
or expand the goods and/or services beyond those in the original application or as acceptably amended. 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06. Generally, any deleted goods and/or services may not later be 
reinserted. See TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.
 
MULTIPLE-CLASS APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
 
The application identifies goods and/or services in more than one international class; therefore, 
applicant must satisfy all the requirements below for each international class based on Trademark Act 
Section 1(b):
 
(1)  List the goods and/or services by their international class number in consecutive 
numerical order, starting with the lowest numbered class.
 
(2)  Submit a filing fee for each international class not covered by the fee(s) already paid 
(view the USPTO’s current fee schedule).  The application identifies goods and/or services that 
are classified in at least 5 classes; however, applicant submitted a fee(s) sufficient for only 1 
class(es).  Applicant must either submit the filing fees for the classes not covered by the 
submitted fees or restrict the application to the number of classes covered by the fees already 
paid.
 
See 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a); TMEP §§1403.01, 1403.02(c).
 
For an overview of the requirements for a Section 1(b) multiple-class application and how to satisfy the 
requirements online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, see the 
Multiple-class Application webpage.
 
RESPONSE GUIDELINES 
 
Response guidelines. For this application to proceed, applicant must explicitly address each refusal 
and/or requirement in this Office action. For a refusal, applicant may provide written arguments and 
evidence against the refusal, and may have other response options if specified above. For a 
requirement, applicant should set forth the changes or statements. Please see “Responding to Office 
Actions” and the informational video “Response to Office Action” for more information and tips on

trademark matters to assist in this process. The assigned trademark examining attorney can provide 
only limited assistance explaining the content of an Office action and the application process. USPTOstaff cannot provide legal advice or statements about an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 
709.06. See Hiring a U.S.-licensed trademark attorney for more information.

•
Update your correspondence email address to ensure you receive important USPTO 
notices about your application.
•
Beware of trademark-related scams. Protect yourself from people and companies that 
may try to take financial advantage of you. Private companies may call you and pretend 
to be the USPTO or may send you communications that resemble official USPTO 
documents to trick you. We will never request your credit card number or social security 
number over the phone. And all official USPTO correspondence will only be emailed 
from the domain “@uspto.gov.” Verify the correspondence originated from us by using 
your Serial Number in our database, TSDR, to confirm that it appears under the 
“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
