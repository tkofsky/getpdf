United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) 
Office Action (Official Letter) About Applicant’s Trademark Application
 
U.S. Application Serial No. 97120897
Mark:  LASH AFTERCARE
Correspondence Address:  
MARIO SIMONYAN 
ESQGO P.C. 
303 NORTH GLENOAKS BOULEVARD, SUITE 200 
BURBANK CA 91502 UNITED STATES
Applicant:  The Boutique Marketing LLC
Reference/Docket No. N/A
Correspondence Email Address:  mario@esqgo.comNONFINAL OFFICE ACTION
 
The USPTO must receive applicant’s response to this letter within six months of the issue date 
below or the application will be abandoned.  Respond using the Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS).  A link to the appropriate TEAS response form appears at the end of this Office 
action.  
Issue date:  August 24, 2022
The referenced application has been reviewed by the assigned trademark examining attorney. Applicant 
must respond timely and completely to the issue(s) below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 
2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.
 
SEARCH OF USPTO DATABASE OF MARKS
 
The trademark examining attorney has searched the USPTO database of registered and pending marks 
and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). 15 
U.S.C. §1052(d); TMEP §704.02.
 
SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
 
Section 2(e)(1) Refusal - Merely Descriptive 
•
Identification of Goods - Amendment Required (Partial Requirement)
•
Domicile Street Address Required
•
 
SECTION 2(e)(1) REFUSAL - MERELY DESCRIPTIVE 
 
Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature, characteristic, purpose 
or function of applicant’s goods.  Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see TMEP 
§§1209.01(b), 1209.03 et seq.
 
In the instant case, applicant seeks registration of the mark LASH AFTERCARE for “Envelopes; 
blank or partially printed postcards; note cards; printed paper matter, namely, blotters, cards, 
brochures, and booklets, all featuring information about fragrances, cosmetics, toiletries, and personal 
care products; printed matter; signboards of paper or cardboard” in International Class 16.
 
The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive is made in relation to an applicant’s goods 
and/or services, not in the abstract.  DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 
1247, 1254, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1757 (Fed. Cir. 2012); In re The Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., 
675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); TMEP §1209.01(b).  “Whether 
consumers could guess what the product [or service] is from consideration of the mark alone is not the 
test.”  In re Am. Greetings Corp., 226 USPQ 365, 366 (TTAB 1985). 
 
The 
attached 
Internet/dictionary evidence, 
consisting 
of 
website 
screenshots 
from https://www.merriam-webster.com (defines 
LASH 
as 
"eyelash"), https://www.collinsdictionary.com (defines AFTERCARE as "any system of maintenance 
or 
upkeep 
of 
an 
appliance 
or 
product", 
for 
example, 
"contact 
lensaftercare), https://www.amazon.com, https://www.etsy.com, https://www.zazzle.com, and the specimen 
of record (page 1), shows that this wording is commonly used in connection with similar goods to refer 
to printed lash extension after care instruction cards. Thus, this wording merely describes a feature of 
applicant’s goods because applicant provides blank or partially printed postcards, note cards, printed 
paper matter, namely, blotters, cards, brochures, and booklets, all featuring information about 
fragrances, cosmetics, toiletries, and personal care products, printed matter, which are broad enough 
to encompass lash extension after care instruction cards. 
 
Consumers who encounter the wording LASH AFTERCARE on the identified goods, would 
immediately understand that applicant’s blank or partially printed postcards, note cards, printed paper 
matter, namely, blotters, cards, brochures, and booklets, all featuring information about fragrances, 
cosmetics, toiletries, and personal care products, printed matter feature lash extension after care 
instruction cards. Therefore, this wording is merely descriptive of a feature of applicant’s goods. 
 
Generally, if the individual components of a mark retain their descriptive meaning in relation to the 
services, the combination results in a composite mark that is itself descriptive and not registrable.  In re 
Fat Boys Water Sports LLC, 118 USPQ2d 1511, 1516 (TTAB 2016) (citing In re Tower Tech, Inc., 64 
USPQ2d 1314, 1317-18 (TTAB 2002)); TMEP §1209.03(d); see, e.g., In re Cannon Safe, Inc., 116 
USPQ2d 1348, 1351 (TTAB 2015) (holding SMART SERIES merely descriptive of metal gun safes); 
In re King Koil Licensing Co., 79 USPQ2d 1048, 1052 (TTAB 2006) (holding THE BREATHABLE 
MATTRESS merely descriptive of beds, mattresses, box springs, and pillows). 
 
Only where the combination of descriptive terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, incongruous, or 
otherwise nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services is the combined mark registrable.  See In 
re Colonial Stores, Inc., 394 F.2d 549, 551, 157 USPQ 382, 384 (C.C.P.A. 1968); In re Positec Grp. 
Ltd., 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1162-63 (TTAB 2013).
 
In this case, both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s 
goods and do not create a unique, incongruous, or nondescriptive meaning in relation to the services.  
Specifically, these individual terms LASH and AFTERCARE merely further refer to a feature of 
applicant’s goods because applicant provides blank or partially printed postcards, note cards, printed 
paper matter, namely, blotters, cards, brochures, and booklets, all featuring information about 
fragrances, cosmetics, toiletries, and personal care products, printed matter, which are broad enough 
to encompass lash extension after care instruction cards.
 
SUMMARY
 
While any doubt regarding the mark’s descriptiveness should be resolved on applicant’s behalf, in the 
present case, the evidence of record leaves no doubt that the mark is merely descriptive.  E.g., In re 
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 828 F.2d 1567, 1571 4 USPQ2d 1141, 1144 (Fed. Cir. 
1987); In re Grand Forest Holdings, Inc., 78 USPQ2d 1152, 1156 (TTAB 2006).
 
As explained above, each term is merely descriptive. In combination, the applied-for mark retains its 
merely descriptive meaning because it advises consumers that the goods are blank or partially printed 
postcards, note cards, printed paper matter, namely, blotters, cards, brochures, and booklets, all 
featuring information about fragrances, cosmetics, toiletries, and personal care products, printed 
matter, including lash extension after care instruction cards. For these reasons, registration is refused 
pursuant to Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act.Although applicant’s mark has been refused registration, applicant may respond to the refusal(s) by 
submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration. However, if applicant responds to the 
refusal(s), applicant must also respond to the requirement(s) set forth below.
 
RESPONSE OPTIONS: SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTER
 
The applied-for mark has been refused registration on the Principal Register.  Applicant may respond to 
the refusal by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration and/or by amending the 
application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register.  See 15 U.S.C. §1091; 37 C.F.R. §§2.47, 
2.75(a); TMEP §§801.02(b), 816.  Amending to the Supplemental Register does not preclude applicant 
from submitting evidence and arguments against the refusal(s).  TMEP §816.04.
 
If applicant amends the application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register, the application 
effective filing date will be the date applicant meets the minimum filing requirements under 37 C.F.R. 
§2.76(c) for an amendment to allege use.  TMEP §§816.02, 1102.03; see 37 C.F.R. §2.75(b).
 
IDENTIFICATION OF GOODS - AMENDMENT REQUIRED (PARTIAL REQUIREMENT)
 
THIS PARTIAL REQUIREMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE GOODS SPECIFIED THEREIN
 
The wording "note cards" in the identification of goods is indefinite and must be clarified because it 
does not sufficiently identify the specific goods encompassed. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(6); TMEP 
§1402.01. For example, the wording "note cards" may encompass  
 
Applicant may substitute the following wording, if accurate: 
 
Class 16: Envelopes; blank or partially printed postcards; {identify type of goods, e.g., blank, printed, 
printed social} note cards; printed paper matter, namely, blotters, {identify type of goods, e.g., blank 
note, note, instructional, picture, informational} cards, brochures, and booklets, all featuring 
information about fragrances, cosmetics, toiletries, and personal care products; printed matter, namely, 
{indetify specific goods in Class 16, e.g., decals for maintenance service and appointment 
reminders, brochures, booklets, and teaching materials in the field of {indicate subject matter or 
field of printed publications and teaching materials}, blank or partially printed postcards}; 
signboards of paper or cardboard
 
Applicant’s goods and/or services may be clarified or limited, but may not be expanded beyond those 
originally itemized in the application or as acceptably amended. See 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP 
§1402.06. Applicant may clarify or limit the identification by inserting qualifying language or deleting 
items to result in a more specific identification; however, applicant may not substitute different goods 
and/or services or add goods and/or services not found or encompassed by those in the original 
application or as acceptably amended. See TMEP §1402.06(a)-(b). The scope of the goods and/or 
services sets the outer limit for any changes to the identification and is generally determined by the 
ordinary meaning of the wording in the identification. TMEP §§1402.06(b), 1402.07(a)-(b). Any 
acceptable changes to the goods and/or services will further limit scope, and once goods and/or services 
are deleted, they are not permitted to be reinserted. TMEP §1402.07(e).
 
For assistance with identifying and classifying goods and services in trademark applications, please see 
the USPTO’s online searchable U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual. See 
TMEP §1402.04.DOMICILE STREET ADDRESS REQUIRED
 
Applicant must clarify its domicile street address because the domicile address of record is for a 
third-party commercial mail receiving agency and does not appear to be applicant’s permanent legal 
place of residence or principal place of business. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.11(b), 2.189; TMEP §601.01(b)(1). 
A domicile address must identify either (1) the permanent legal place of residence, which is the place 
an individual applicant resides and intends to be the applicant’s principal home; or (2) the principal 
place of business, which is the juristic applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities.  See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §803.05(a).
 
In this case, the application record lists applicant as a juristic entity and specifies applicant’s domicile 
address as follows: 2119 Riverwalk Drive, #318, Moore, OK 73160. This address has been identified as 
a commercial mail receiving agency by the U.S. Postal Service Coding Accuracy Support System 
(CASS) and thus does not appear to be applicant’s headquarters where its senior executives or officers 
ordinarily direct and control the entity’s activities. See 37 C.F.R. §2.2(o)-(p); TMEP §601.01(b)(1). A 
commercial mail receiving agency is a private business that accepts mail from the U.S. Postal Service 
on behalf of third parties. See attached evidence. 
 
Response options. Applicant must provide its domicile street address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(2), 
2.189; TMEP §803.05. Alternatively, applicant may provide (1) documentation showing that the listed 
U.S. domicile address is, in fact, applicant’s domicile, or (2) a detailed explanation supporting that 
applicant has no fixed physical address. See 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b); TMEP §§601.01(b)-(b)(1), 803.05(a).
 
To provide applicant’s domicile street address. After opening the correct Trademark Electronic 
Application System (TEAS) response form and entering the serial number, (1) answer “yes” to question 
5 and click “Continue;” (2) on the “Owner Information” page, in the “Domicile Address” field, 
uncheck the box stating the domicile and mailing address are not the same; and (3) below the checkbox 
provide applicant’s domicile street address. Applicant’s domicile street address will be hidden from 
public view if it is entered into the “Domicile Address” field. However, any street address listed in the 
“Mailing Address” field will be publicly viewable.
 
To provide documentation to support applicant’s U.S. domicile address. Applicant should provide 
the most recent documentation showing that the address is the applicant’s business headquarters, for 
example one of the following: (1) the most recent final annual or quarterly report or other similar 
report; or (2) a current, valid signed rental, lease, or mortgage agreement for office space. TMEP 
§601.01(b)-(b)(1); see 37 C.F.R. §2.11(b). Submitted documentation must show the name, listed 
domicile address, and the date of the document but should redact other personal and financial 
information.
 
To provide this documentation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, 
answer “yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, below the “Miscellaneous 
Statement” field, click the button below the text box to attach documentation to support the U.S. street 
address.
 
To provide a detailed explanation that applicant has no fixed physical address. If applicant has no 
physical headquarters where its senior executives or officers ordinarily direct and control the business 
(e.g., because the business is conducted virtually), applicant should state for the record that applicant 
has no fixed physical address and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances.To provide this explanation, open the correct TEAS response form and enter the serial number, answer 
“yes” to question 3, and on the “Additional Statement(s)” page, in the “Miscellaneous Statement” field, 
enter the referenced explanation in the text box.

“Documents” tab, or contact the Trademark Assistance Center. 
•Hiring a U.S.-licensed attorney. If you do not have an attorney and are not required to 
have one under the trademark rules, we encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney 
specializing in trademark law to help guide you through the registration process. The 
USPTO examining attorney is not your attorney and cannot give you legal advice, but 
rather works for and represents the USPTO in trademark matters.
